<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>According to the Spanish critics, the novel has flourished
in Spain during only two epochs&mdash;the golden age of Cervantes
and the period in which we are still living. That
unbroken line of romance-writing which has existed for so
long a time in France and in England, is not to be looked
for in the Peninsula. The novel in Spain is a re-creation
of our own days; but it has made, since the middle of the
nineteenth century, two or three fresh starts. The first
modern Spanish novelists were what are called the <i>walter-scottistas</i>,
although they were inspired as much by George
Sand as by the author of <i>Waverley</i>. These writers were of
a romantic order, and Fernan Caballero, whose earliest
novel dates from 1849, was at their head. The Revolution
of September, 1868, marked an advance in Spanish fiction,
and Valera came forward as the leader of a more national
and more healthily vitalised species of imaginative work.
The pure and exquisite style of Valera is, doubtless, only to
be appreciated by a Castilian. Something of its charm may
be divined, however, even in the English translation of his
masterpiece, <i>Pepita Jiménez</i>. The mystical and aristocratic
genius of Valera appealed to a small audience; he has
confided to the world that when all were praising but few
were buying his books.</p>

<p>Far greater fecundity and a more directly successful
appeal to the public, were, somewhat later, the characteristics
of Perez y Galdos, whose vigorous novels, spoiled a
little for a foreign reader by their didactic diffuseness,
are well-known in this country. In the hands of Galdos, a
further step was taken by Spanish fiction towards the
rejection of romantic optimism and the adoption of a
modified realism. In Pereda, so the Spanish critics tell us,
a still more valiant champion of naturalism was found,
whose studies of local manners in the province of Santander
recall to mind the paintings of Teniers. About 1875 was
the date when the struggle commenced in good earnest
between the schools of romanticism and realism. In 1881
Galdos definitely joined the ranks of the realists with his
<i>La Desheredada</i>. An eminent Spanish writer, Emilio Pardo
Bazan, thus described the position some six years ago: "It
is true that the battle is not a noisy one, and excites no
great warlike ardour. The question is not taken up amongst
us with the same heat as in France, and this from several
causes. In the first place, the idealists with us do not walk
in the clouds so much as they do in France, nor do the
realists load their palette so heavily. Neither school exaggerates
in order to distinguish itself from the other. Perhaps
our public is indifferent to literature, especially to printed
literature, for what is represented on the stage produces
more impression."</p>

<p>This indifference of the Spanish reading public, which
has led a living novelist to declare that a person of good
position in Madrid would rather spend his money on fireworks
or on oranges than on a book, has at length been in
a measure dissipated by a writer who is not merely admired
and distinguished, but positively popular, and who, without
sacrificing style, has conquered the unwilling Spanish public.
This is Armando Palacio Valdés, who was born on the 4th
of October 1853, in a hamlet in the mountains of Asturias,
called Entralgo, where his family possessed a country-house.
The family spent only the summer there; the remainder of
the year they passed in Avilés, the maritime town which
Valdés describes under the name of Nieva in his novel
<i>Marta y Maria</i>. He began his education at Oviedo, the
capital of Asturias. From this city he went, in 1870, up to
Madrid to study the law as a profession. But even in the
lawyer's office, his dream was to become a man of letters.
His ambition took the form of obtaining at some university
a chair of political economy, to which science he had, or
fancied himself to have, at that time a great proclivity.</p>

<p>Before terminating his legal studies, the young man
published several articles in the <i>Revista Europea</i> on philosophical
and religious questions. These articles attracted
the attention of the proprietor of that review, and Valdés
presently joined the staff. In 1874 he became editor. He
was at the head of the <i>Revista Europea</i>, at that time the
most important periodical in Spain from a scientific point of
view, for several years. During that time he published the
main part of those articles of literary criticism, particularly
on contemporary poets and novelists, which have since been
collected in several volumes&mdash;<i>Los Oradores del Ateneo</i>,
("The Orators of the Athenæum"); <i>Los Novelistas Españoles</i>
("The Spanish Novelists"); <i>Un Nuevo Viaje al Parnaso</i>
("A New Journey to Parnassus"), sketches of the living
poets of Spain; and, in particular, a very bright collection
of review articles published in conjunction with Leopoldo
Alas, <i>La Literatura en</i> 1881 ("Spanish Literature in 1881").
These gave Valdés a foremost rank among the critics of the
day. He wrote no more criticism, or very little; he
determined to place himself amongst those whose creative
work demands the careful consideration of the best judges.</p>

<p>Soon after he took the direction of the <i>Revista</i>, Valdés
wrote his first novel, <i>El Señorito Octavio</i>, which was not
published until 1881. In 1883 he brought out his <i>Marta y
Maria</i>, a book which, I know not why, is called "The
Marquis of Peñalta" in its English version. This novel
enjoyed an extraordinary success, and had more of the
graphic and sprightly manner by which Valdés has since
been distinguished, than the books which immediately
followed it. Spanish critics, indeed, remembering the
wonderful freshness of <i>Marta y Maria</i>, still often speak of
it as the best of Valdés' stories. In this same year, 1883,
he married, at the seaside town of Gijon, in Asturias, on
the day when he completed his thirty years, a young lady of
sixteen. His marriage was a honeymoon of a year and a
half, of which <i>El Idilio de un Enfermo</i> ("The Idyll of an
Invalid"), a short novel of 1884, portrays the earlier
portion. His wife died early in 1885, leaving him with an
infant son to be, as he says, "my allusion and my fascination."
His subsequent career has been laborious and
systematic. He has published one novel almost every year.
In 1885 it was <i>José</i>, a shorter tale of sea-faring life on the
stormy coast of the author's native province. About the
same time appeared a collection of short stories, called
<i>Aguas Fuertes</i> ("Strong Waters").</p>

<p>It was not until 1886, however, that Valdés began to
rank among the foremost novelists of Europe. In that
year he published his great story, <i>Riverita</i>, one of the
characters in which, a charming child, became the heroine
of his next book, <i>Maximina</i>, 1887. Of this character he
writes to me: "My Maximina in these two books is but a
pale reflection of that being from whom Providence parted
me before she was eighteen years of age. In these novels
I have painted a great part of my life." A Sevillian novice,
who has helped to care for Maximina in Madrid, reigns
supreme in a succeeding novel, <i>La Hermana San Sulpicio</i>
("Sister San Sulpicio"), 1889. But between these two last
there comes a massive novel, describing the adventures of a
journalist who founds a newspaper in the provincial town of
Sarrió, by which Gijon seems to be intended. This book
is called <i>El Cuarto Poder</i> ("The Fourth Power"), and was
published in 1888. To these, in 1891, was added <i>La
Espuma</i> ("Froth"), of which a translation has already
appeared in the "International Library." In 1892 Valdés
published <i>La Fé</i> ("Faith").</p>

<p>In <i>La Espuma</i>, his best-known novel, Valdés reverted
from those country scenes and those streets of provincial
cities which he had hitherto loved best to paint, and gave
us a sternly satiric picture of the frothy surface of fashionable
life in Madrid. From the illusions of the poor,
pathetic and often beautiful, he turned to the ugly cynicism
of the wealthy. With his passion for honesty and simplicity,
his heart burned within him at the parade and
hollowness which he detected in aristocratic and bureaucratic
Madrid. One conceives that, like his own Raimundo,
he was invited to enter it, took his fill of its pleasures, and
found his mouth filled with ashes. His talent for portraiture
was never better employed. If he was occasionally
tempted to commit the peculiarly Spanish fault of exaggeration&mdash;scarcely
a fault there, where the shadows are so
black and the colours so flaring&mdash;he resisted it in his more
important characters. The brutality of the Duke de
Requena, the sagacity and urbanity of Father Ortega, the
saintly sweetness of the Duchess, the naïveté of Raimundo,
the sphinx-like charm of Clementina de Osorio, with her
mysterious sweetness and duplicity, these are among the
salient points of characterisation which stand out in this
powerful book. <i>La Espuma</i> was a cry from the desert
to those who wear soft raiment in king's palaces. It was
the ruthless tearing aside of the conventions by a Knox
or a Savonarola. It was stringent satire, yet tempered
with an artist's moderation, with a naturalist's self-suppression.</p>

<p>The latest novel which Valdés has published is that
which we here present under the title of <i>The Grandee</i> ("El
Maestrante"). Here, as it will be seen, the author is no
longer engaged in the jarring notes of satire, but, with more
lightness and a greater effusion of humour, he dissects the
quaint elements which make up old-fashioned society in a
provincial city of Spain. This is one of those books which
peculiarly appeal to the foreign reader who desires to enter
into a phase of life from which his own experience
absolutely excludes him. We may suppose that a limited
number of Englishmen can penetrate to the palaces and the
club-rooms of Madrid, and see something, however superficially,
of the life described in <i>Froth</i>. But the grim and
ancient mansions which look down through ancient
mullioned windows on the narrow streets of such a town as
is brought before us in <i>The Grandee</i>&mdash;what can the most
privileged Englishman possibly know of the manners and
customs of their stately inhabitants?</p>

<p>In the second half of the book, the gaiety and grotesqueness
of the pictures of life sink before the solemnity of the
terrible and tragic corruption of Amalia, and the martyrdom
of Josefina. The last pages of <i>The Grandee</i> are, indeed,
tinged with almost intolerable gloom, and in a society comparatively
so civilised as our own, the revenge of the unnatural
mother may seem almost overdrawn. The author
contends, however, that in the cryptic and cloistered
provincial life which he describes, where the light of
censure can hardly reach a powerful criminal, such wickedness
as is perpetrated upon Josefina is neither improbable
nor unprecedented. Nor do the reports of Mr. Benjamin
Waugh permit us to question that such horrors are daily
committed at our own doors. Whether these maladies of
the soul are or are not fit subjects for the art of the novelist
is a question which every reader must answer for himself.</p>

<p>In the pages of <i>The Grandee</i> we have a singular transcript
of Spanish pride and picturesqueness, of a narrow
society absolutely fortified against public opinion by its
ancient prejudices, a society, nevertheless, in which the
primitive passions of humanity stir and interact with as
much dangerous vivacity as in freer and more democratic
conditions. I may perhaps mention, on the authority of
the author, that by Lancia Valdés intends us to understand
Oviedo, the capital of the province of Asturias, where he
spent many years of his childhood and early youth. The
story opens between thirty and forty years ago, and represents
Oviedo and its social customs at an epoch a little
earlier than the time when the novelist was forming his
freshest and most vivid impressions of life.</p>

<p>Of the author of so many interesting books but little has
yet been told to the public. In a private letter to myself,
the eminent novelist gives a brief sketch of his mode of life,
so interesting that I have secured his permission to translate
and print it here:&mdash;"Since my wife died," Señor
Valdés writes, "my life has continued to be tranquil and
melancholy, dedicated to work and to my son. During the
winters, I live in Asturias, and during the summers, in
Madrid. I like the company of men of the world better
than that of literary folks, because the former teach me
more. I am given up to the study of metaphysics. I have
a passion for physical exercises, for gymnastics, for fencing,
and I try to live in an evenly-balanced temper, nothing
being so repugnant to me as affectation and emphasis. I
find a good deal of pleasure in going to bull-fights (although
I do not take my son to the Plaza dressed up like a
miniature <i>torero</i>, as an American writer declares I do), and
I cultivate the theatre, because to see life from the stage
point of view helps me in the composition of my stories."</p>

<p class="head">THE GRANDEE'S HOUSE</p>


<p class="nind">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was ten o'clock at night, an hour when the number of
those who frequented the streets of the noble city of Lancia
was always of the scantiest, but in the depth of winter, when
our story opens, with a bitter north-east wind and drenching
rain, one would find it difficult to stumble upon a living
soul. Not that all had surrendered themselves into the
arms of Morpheus, for Lancia as capital of a province,
albeit not one of the most important, had learnt to sit up
late. But the people used to resort at an early hour to
parties, whence they only sallied forth to supper and to bed
at eleven o'clock. At that hour many noisy groups could be
seen passing along under the shelter of umbrellas, the
ladies enveloped in warm woollen cloaks, holding up their
petticoats, and the gentlemen all wrapped in their cloaks, or
<i>montecristos</i>, with their trousers well turned up, breaking
the silence of the night by the loud clack of their wooden
shoes. For at the time of which we speak there were few
that despised this comfortable shoe of the country, unless it
were some new-fledged medical student from Valladolid,
who considered himself above such old-fashioned things, or
some fanciful young lady, who pretended that she could not
walk in them. But these were the exceptions. There<a name="Page_002" id="Page_002"></a>
were no carriages in the town, for only three existed in the
place, belonging respectively to the Quiñones, the Countess
of Onis, and to Estrada-Rosa; the last-mentioned being
the only one that did not date from the middle of the last
century. When either of these conveyances appeared in
the street, it was followed by a crowd of little urchins, whose
enthusiasm at the sight knew no bounds. The neighbours
inside their houses could tell by the sound of the wheels,
and the clink of the horseshoes to which of the above-mentioned
magnates the carriage belonged. They were in
fact three venerated institutions which the natives of the
city had learnt to love and respect. So umbrellas and
wooden shoes were the only protections against the rain
that falls more than three parts of the year. India-rubber
shoes came in later, as well as hooded waterproofs, which
at certain times transform Lancia into a vast community of
Carthusian friars.</p>

<p>The wind blew stronger at the crossing of Santa Barbara
than in any other part of the town. This uncovered
passage, between the bishop's palace and the walls of a
courtyard of the cathedral, just by the chain which regulates
the lightning conductor, leads finally under an
archway, a murky corner where the blast, confined within
a narrow space, howls and moans on such infernal nights
as this.</p>

<p>A man, muffled up to the eyes, crossed with rapid steps
the little square in front of the archbishop's house, and
entered this recess. The force of the hurricane stopped
him, and the rain penetrating between the collar of his
coat and the brim of his hat, almost blinded him. He
made a few seconds' stand against the violence of the
whirlwind, and then, instead of uttering any exclamation of
impatience, which would have been more than excusable
under the circumstances, he merely gave vent to a long-drawn
sigh of distress:</p>

<p>"Oh! my Jesus! what a night!"<a name="Page_003" id="Page_003"></a></p>

<p>He cowered up against the wall, and when the wind had
somewhat abated, he resumed his course. Passing under
the archway that connects the palace with the cathedral, he
entered the widest and best-lighted part of the passage.
An oil-lamp fixed in the corner served as its only light.
The wretched thing, seconded by a tinfoil reflector placed
at the back, made ineffectual attempts to pierce the gloom
of the farthest corners.</p>

<p>Ten yards off nobody would have thought it was there,
and yet to our muffled traveller it must have seemed an
Edison lamp of ten thousand candle-power, from the way
he drew his coat-collar higher about his face, and from the
haste in which he avoided the pavement, and crept along
by the wall where the shadows were deepest. In this way
he arrived at the Calle de Santa Lucia, cast a rapid glance
around him, and renewed his course on the darkest side of
the way. Although one of the most central streets, the
Calle de Santa Lucia is solitary to an extreme. It is closed
at one end by the base of the tower of the cathedral, a
graceful, elegant structure like few to be found in Spain,
and so it is only used as a thoroughfare by canons going to
the choir, or devotees on their way to early Mass. In this
short, straight, narrow street, the palace of Quiñones de
Leon was situated&mdash;a large, dreary, uninteresting-looking
building with projecting iron balconies. It was two storeys
high, and over the central balcony there was an enormous
roughly carved shield, supported by two griffins in high
relief, as rudely carved as the quarterings.</p>

<p>One side of the house looked on to a little, damp, melancholy,
neglected garden, enclosed by a wall of regular
elevation; and the other on to a dull, even damper, narrow
street which ran between the house and the black, discoloured
wall of the church of San Rafael. To pass from
the palace to the church, where the Quiñones had a private
pew, was a little gallery, or covered way, smaller, but similar
to that of the archbishop, over the passage of Santa Barbara.<a name="Page_004" id="Page_004"></a></p>

<p>By the bright light shining from the crevice of a half-opened
window on the balcony, it was evident that the
people of the house had not yet retired to rest. And if the
light were not sufficient proof, the fact was confirmed by
the strains of a piano heard occasionally above the roar of
the storm.</p>

<p>Our muffled friend, with a rapid step, keeping as much
in shadow as possible, arrived at the door of the palace.
There he stopped again, cast a furtive glance down both
sides of the street, and entered the portico. It was large,
and paved with stones like the street; the bare, discoloured,
whitewashed walls were dimly illumined by an oil-lamp
hung from the centre. The man quickly crossed it, and
before pulling the bell-cord, placed his ear to the door, and
listened long and attentively. Convinced that nobody was
descending the staircase, he gave one more look down the
street. At last he decided to undo his cloak, and drew
from under its folds a bundle, which he placed with a
trembling hand near the door. It was a basket, covered
with a woman's mantle, which hid the contents from view,
although they could be pretty well guessed, for from the
time of Moses, mysterious baskets seem destined for the
consignment of infants.</p>

<p>The man, being now free of his burthen, pulled the bell-cord
three times, and the door was immediately opened
from above by means of another cord. The three pulls of
the bell showed that the visitor to the aristocratic mansion
of the Quiñones was a nobleman on a par with the Señores.
This was an old-established custom of unknown origin. A
menial, a servant, an inferior in any degree, only rang once,
ordinary visitors rang twice, and the half dozen, or more,
persons that the important Señor of Quiñones considered
his equals in Lancia, rang three times. If those in the
town, who had never been admitted to the sacred precincts
of the mansion, joked with the habitués of the place on the
subject, their witticisms fell flat; but even if the shafts did<a name="Page_005" id="Page_005"></a>
go home, the feudal custom was so universally respected,
that none but the privileged few dared to give the three
signals pertaining to the highest rank. Paco Gomez once
ventured to break the rule for a joke, but he was received
so coldly when he entered the drawing-room that he never
cared to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>So the man of the basket entered quickly, shut the door,
crossed the hall, and ascended the wide stone staircase,
where holes, worn by long use, retained the damp.</p>

<p>When he reached the first floor, a servant approached to
take his hat and cloak; so without further delay, and as if
avoiding pursuit, he darted with hasty stride towards the
drawing-room door, and opened it. The light of the
chandelier and candelabra dazzled him for a moment. He
was a tall powerful man, between thirty and thirty-two
years of age, with a pleasant expression of countenance and
regular features, short hair, and a long, silky beard of
reddish hue. His face was pale, and betrayed extreme
anxiety. On raising his eyes, which the excessive brightness
of the room at first obliged him to lower, he turned them
on the lady of the house, who was seated in an armchair.
She, on her side, cast an inquiring anxious look at him, and
the glance caused him a shock which gave instantaneous
repose to his face like the neutralisation of two equal forces.</p>

<p>The gentleman remained at the door waiting for five or
six couples, who were pirouetting to the strains of a waltz, to
pass him, whilst his pale lips wreathed into a smile as sweet
as it was sad.</p>

<p>"What an evening! We did not think you would be
here so soon," exclaimed the lady as she gave him her
delicate nervous hand, which contracted three or four times
with intense emotion as it came in contact with his.</p>

<p>She was a woman of about twenty-eight or thirty years
of age, diminutive in stature, with a pale, expressive face,
very black eyes and hair, small mouth, and delicate aquiline
nose.<a name="Page_006" id="Page_006"></a></p>

<p>"How are you, Amalia?" said the gentleman, without
replying to her remark, and trying to hide under a smile the
anxiety which, in spite of himself, the trembling of his voice
betrayed.</p>

<p>"I am better, thank you."</p>

<p>"Is not this noise bad for you?"</p>

<p>"No; I was bored to death in bed. Besides, I did not
wish to deprive the young people of the one enjoyment
they can get occasionally at Lancia."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Amalia," exclaimed a young lady who was
dancing and overheard the last remark, and Amalia responded
by a kind smile.</p>

<p>Another couple from behind then knocked against the
gentleman, who was still standing.</p>

<p>"Always devoted, Luis!"</p>

<p>"To no one more than yourself, Maria," replied the
young man, affecting to hide his embarrassment under a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that I am the only one?" she asked with
a mischievous glance at the partner who held her in his
arms.</p>

<p>Maria Josefa Hevia was at least forty, and she had been
almost as ugly at fifteen. As her means were not equal to
her weight, no one had dared redeem her from the purgatory
of solitude. Until quite lately she still entertained hopes
that one of the elderly Indian bachelors, who came to pass
their declining years in Lancia, would ask her hand in
marriage; and these hopes were founded on the fact that
these gentlemen frequently contracted alliances with the
daughters of distinguished people in the place, portionless
as they generally were.</p>

<p>On her father's side, Maria Josefa was connected with
one of the oldest families, being related to the Señor of
Quiñones, in whose house we now are.</p>

<p>But her father was dead, and she lived with her mother,
a woman of low degree, who had been a cook before<a name="Page_007" id="Page_007"></a>
marrying her master. Either for this reason, or on account
of the indisputable ugliness of her face, the Indians fought
shy of her; although her exaggerated idea of her position
exacted a certain respect in society. Her face was
hideous, with irregular features, marked with erysipelas,
and disfigured by red patches about the nostrils. She
only retained one feminine taste, and that was for
dancing, which was a real passion with her; and she felt it
dreadfully when she was left a wallflower by the careless
young men of Lancia. But, possessing a sharp tongue, she
revenged herself so cleverly on both sexes when thus
neglected, that the majority of the youths willingly sacrificed
one dance on the programme to her at all the
balls; and when they failed to do so, the girls would
remind them of their duty, so great was their fear of the
spiteful old maid. Thus, by dint of the wholesome terror
she inspired, she danced as much as the greatest beauty in
Lancia.</p>

<p>She was conscious of the reason of her success, and however
humiliated she might be in the depths of her heart, she
did not fail to make use of the power, as she considered it
the lesser evil of the two.</p>

<p>Witty and malicious, she was particularly alive to a sense
of the ridiculous in things, and whilst not lacking in the
power of narration, she was, moreover, endowed with the
peculiar knack of wounding everybody to the quick when
she had a mind to.</p>

<p>"Has the count come yet?" asked a sharp voice from
the next room, which made itself heard above the sounds of
the piano, and the feet of the dancers.</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am, Don Pedro; I am coming."</p>

<p>Whereupon the count made a step towards the door,
without removing his eye from the pallid-looking lady; and
she riveted another steady gaze upon him, which conveyed
the impression of a question. He just closed his eyes in
affirmatory reply, and passed on to the next apartment,<a name="Page_008" id="Page_008"></a>
which, like the drawing-room, was furnished without any
regard for luxury.</p>

<p>The highest nobility of Lancia despised all the refinements
of decoration so usual nowadays. They scorned
every innovation both within and without their dwellings;
and this not from feelings of avarice, but from the inborn
conviction that their superiority consisted less in the richness
and splendour of their houses, than in the seal of
ancient respectability.</p>

<p>The furniture was old and shabby, and the carpets and
curtains were faded; but the master paid little heed to
such matters. Indeed, Don Pedro Quiñones showed an
indifference, bordering upon eccentricity, on the point.
Neither the entreaties of his wife, nor the remarks which
some bolder spirit, like Paco Gomez, who was always ready
to be facetious, dared to make, ever induced him to call in
the painters and upholsterers.</p>

<p>With regard to size, the drawing-room was superb, being
both lofty and spacious, and including all the windows of
the Calle de Santa Lucia, with the exception of that of the
library. The chairs were antique, not a mere imitation of
those of bygone ages, as is now the mode, but made in
times past, according to the fashion of the period, and
covered with green velvet, worn old by time. In many
places the floor was visible through the holes in the
carpet. The walls were covered with magnificent tapestries,
which constituted the one adornment of the house,
for Don Pedro had a very valuable collection; but he only
exhibited it once a year, when the balconies were draped
on the day of Corpus Christi. It was said that an Englishman
once offered a million pesetas<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> for their possession.</p>

<p>The count had also several very valuable pictures, but
they were so discoloured by time that, if not restored before
long by some skilful hand, they seemed likely to disappear<a name="Page_009" id="Page_009"></a>
altogether. The only new thing in the drawing-room was
the piano, bought three years ago, soon after the second
marriage of Don Pedro.</p>

<p>The library, also of large dimensions, with a window
looking on to the Calle de Santa Lucia, and two on to the
garden, was furnished still worse. It had heavy damask
curtains, two mahogany presses without mirrors, a sofa
upholstered with silk, a few leather chairs, a round table in
the centre, and some seats to match the sofa, all old and
shabby.</p>

<p>Seated round the table, lighted by an enormous oil-lamp,
were three gentlemen playing at tresillo.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>The master of the house was one of them. He was
between forty-six and forty-eight years of age. For the
last three years he had been quite unable to move from
the effects of an apoplectic stroke, which left him with both
legs paralysed. He was stout, with a red face, and strong
well-marked features; his thick curly hair and beard were
streaked with grey, and he had keen, piercing black eyes.
His face was remarkable for an expression of pride and
fierceness, which the kind smile with which he received the
Conde de Onis could not entirely hide. He was sitting,
or rather reclining, in an armchair constructed especially
for facilitating the movement of his body and arms; and
it was placed sideways at the table, so that he could play,
and keep his legs raised up meanwhile. Although there
were logs burning on the hearth, he had a grey cloak round
his shoulders, fastened at the throat with a gold clasp.
Embroidered on the left-hand side was the large red cross
of the order of Calatrava.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The Señor of Quiñones was
rarely seen without this cloak, which afforded him a fantastic,
somewhat theatrical, appearance. He had always been
eccentric in his dress. His pride impelled him to try and<a name="Page_010" id="Page_010"></a>
distinguish himself from the vulgar in every way. On
ordinary occasions he wore a buttoned-up frock-coat, a
high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat, and his hair was long,
like that of a cavalier of the seventeenth century, whilst
his clothes were generally of velvet or velveteen, with
riding-boots of a fashion beyond all recollection, and his
wide shirt-collars were turned back over his waistcoat in
imitation of the Walloon style. There never was a man
prouder of his high degree, nor more retentive of the privileges
enjoyed by those of his rank in times gone by.
People grumbled at his eccentricities, and many turned
them to ridicule, for Lancia is a place not wanting in a
sense of humour. But, as usual, unbending pride had
ended by making an impression. Those who were the
first to joke at Don Pedro's peculiarities, were those who
were the most punctiliously respectful in doffing their hats
when he appeared almost half a mile off. He had lived
some years at Court, but he did not strike root there. He
was one of the gentlemen in office, and curiously jealous
of every prerogative and distinction due to his fortune and
birth. But there was no satisfying a heart so corroded
with arrogance, and he bitterly resented the amalgamation
of people of birth with those of money. The respect
afforded to politicians, which he in his position also had to
accede to, perfectly enraged him. Was a son of a nobody,
a common fellow, to take precedence of him, and merely
give an indifferent or disdainful glance at him?&mdash;at him,
the descendant of the proud Counts of Castille! Not being
able to put up with such a state of things, he resigned his
appointment, and took up his abode again in the old-world
palace in which we now are. His pride, or maybe
his eccentric character, made the rich bachelor at this time
of his life do a thousand odd and ridiculous things, to the
great astonishment of the town until it became accustomed
to him. Don Pedro never went out in the street without
being accompanied by a servant, or majordomo, a rough<a name="Page_011" id="Page_011"></a>
sort of man who wore the costume of the peasants of
the country, which consisted of short breeches, woollen
stockings, a green cloth jacket, and a wide-brimmed hat.
And he not only went out with Manin (he was universally
known by this name), but he also took him to the theatre
with him. It was a sight to see these two in one of the
best boxes: the master stiff and decorous, with his eyes
roaming carelessly round; whilst the servant sat with his
bearded chin resting on his hands, which clasped the
balustrade, staring fixedly at the stage, occasionally giving
vent to loud guffaws of laughter, scratching his head, or
yawning loudly in the middle of a silence.</p>

<p>Manin soon became a regular institution.</p>

<p>Don Pedro, who scarcely deigned to converse with the
wealthiest people of Lancia, talked familiarly with this
servant, and allowed him to contradict him in the rude
rough way peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>"Manin, man, be careful not to give these ladies too
much trouble," he would say to the majordomo when they
entered some shop together.</p>

<p>"All right," returned the rough fellow in a loud voice, "if
they want to be at their ease, let them bring a mattress from
home and recline upon it."</p>

<p>Don Pedro would then bite his lips to keep from laughing,
for such coarse and brutal remarks were just to his taste.</p>

<p>When they repaired to a café, Manin drank quarts of red
wine, whilst his master only sipped a glass of muscat. But
although he left it almost full, he always asked and paid
for a whole bottle.</p>

<p>An apothecary of the place, with whom the count sometimes
condescended to have a chat, once evinced some
surprise at this extravagance, but he returned with chilly
arrogance:</p>

<p>"I pay for a whole bottle because I think it would be
unseemly for Don Pedro Quiñones de Leon to ask for a
glass like some ink-stained clerk in a government office."<a name="Page_012" id="Page_012"></a></p>

<p>The whole town was impressed with his manners, for
when he met any clerics in the streets, he kissed their hands
in accordance with the custom of noblemen of bygone
centuries. But, like all the rest of his ways, this respect was
nothing but a wish to appear different to other people, and
to show that he belonged to the old <i>régime</i>; because, although
he kissed the hand of his own chaplain in public, he treated
him like a servant in private, and, in fact, accorded him far
less consideration than he did Manin.</p>

<p>But what most astonished the place, and gave rise to no
end of remarks and jokes, was what Don Pedro did with a
certain religious solemnity soon after his arrival from Madrid.
He appeared at church in the white uniform trimmed with
twisted cords pertaining to the office of <i>Maestrante de Ronda</i>.</p>

<p>Just before the elevation of the Host at the Mass, he
advanced with a solemn step to the empty space in the
centre of the edifice, unsheathed his sword, and made sharp,
firm passes in the air, in the direction of the four cardinal
points. The women were frightened, the children ran away,
and the majority of the congregation thought he had
suddenly gone out of his mind. But those who were better
informed, and more intellectual, understood that it was meant
to be a symbolical ceremony, and that those thrusts in the
air signified Don Pedro's resolution, as a noble member of a
military Order, to fight all the enemies of the faith from every
quarter of the globe. The one little periodical published at
that time in Lancia (now there are eleven&mdash;six dailies, and
five weeklies) devoted a whole page to a humorous account
of this event.</p>

<p>But in spite of the eccentricities of his public and private
life, the prestige enjoyed by the illustrious nobleman in the
town was by no means affected.</p>

<p>He, who in perfect good faith considers himself superior
to those about him, is in no danger of humiliation. In spite
of his affectations, Don Pedro was a man of culture, fond of
literature, and endowed with a taste for poetry. He had<a name="Page_013" id="Page_013"></a>
been known occasionally to celebrate events pertaining to
the kingdom, or the royal family in several stanzas of a
classic, somewhat pompous, style. But although people had
tried to persuade him to publish them, he never would
consent to do so.</p>

<p>Periodicals were one of his particular aversions, for he
considered them a sign of the democracy of the times. So
he preferred to keep his poems in manuscript, known only
to a select circle of friends.</p>

<p>He also had a reputation as a man of valour. He had fought
a few duels in Madrid, and in Lancia he had one with
a certain political chief, sent by the progressionists to the
province through the intervention of the archbishop and
Chapter of the cathedral. When he was about forty years
of age, our friend married a lady of position who lived in
Sarrió. But his wife died within the year, just when he had
hopes of an heir to his name and estates. Three years after,
he contracted another marriage&mdash;this time with Amalia, a
Valencian lady, who was a connection of his. They scarcely
knew each other, for Don Pedro had not seen her since she
was fourteen. The alliance formed ten years later was
arranged by letters, and an interchange of photographs.
There was no doubt that the bride's will was coerced in the
matter, and it was said that for many months she had a
separate room to her husband. And the story was told in
Lancia, with no lack of detail, how Don Pedro, in pursuance
of a canon's advice, managed to overcome these scruples.
But in spite of the success of the suggestion of the church
dignitary, and the subsequent concession of conjugal rights,
Heaven did not see fit to bless the union.</p>

<p>Not long after, Don Pedro was seized with the dreadful
apoplectic attack which paralysed the whole of the lower part
of his body, and the poor man was much tempted to curse
his affliction, although no doubt it was ordered for the best.</p>

<p>"We are in want of a fourth," he said, warmly shaking
hands with the count.<a name="Page_014" id="Page_014"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, yes, and we will see if the luck will change, for
Moro is winning all our money," said a little old man with a
strong Galician accent. He had a fresh, clean-shaven, round
face, white hair, and clear, kind eyes. His name was
Saleta, and he was a magistrate of the Court of Justice, and
a constant visitor at the Quiñones' house.</p>

<p>"Not so much as that, Señor Saleta, not so much!
I have only two hundred counters, and I want three
hundred to make up for what I lost yesterday," returned
the man referred to, who was a youth with a genial frank
expression of countenance.</p>

<p>"And why did you not call upon Manin?" asked the
count with a smile as he glanced at the celebrated
majordomo, who in his short breeches, woollen stockings,
and green cloth jacket, was sleeping in an armchair.</p>

<p>The other three turned and looked at the man.</p>

<p>"Because Manin is a brute who can play at nothing but
<i>brisca</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> said Don Pedro, smiling.</p>

<p>"And at <i>tute</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> returned the fellow, opening his mouth
and yawning loudly.</p>

<p>"All right, and at <i>tute</i>."<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"And at <i>monte</i>."<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"Very well, man, and at <i>monte</i>, too."</p>

<p>And the friends went on with their cards without paying
further attention to Manin, but presently he began again by
saying:</p>

<p>"And at <i>parar</i>."
<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"And at <i>parar</i>, too?" asked the count in a joking tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, señor, and at <i>los siete y media</i>."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>"Get along!" said the other, absently, as he opened his
hand of cards and examined it attentively.</p>

<p>Then they went on playing with much interest, absorbed
and silent. But the majordomo interrupted them again by
saying:<a name="Page_015" id="Page_015"></a></p>

<p>"And at <i>julepe</i>."</p>

<p>"All right, Manin, be quiet and don't be a fool," said Don
Pedro, crossly.</p>

<p>"Fool, fool," muttered the peasant, surlily; "there are a
good many fools about, but as they have money there is no
one to call them so."</p>

<p>He then re-settled his broad shoulders in the seat,
stretched out his legs, closed his eyes, and began to
snore.</p>

<p>The players turned their eyes on Don Pedro in surprise,
and some anxiety.</p>

<p>The master looked wrathfully at his majordomo; but
seeing him in such a comfortable position he changed his
mind, and, shrugging his shoulders, he turned his attention
to his cards, merely remarking with a pleasant smile:</p>

<p>"What a barbarian! He is a regular Sueve."</p>

<p>"But, Señor Quiñones," said Saleta, "the Suevi only
settled in Galicia. You are nothing but Cantabrians, and I
have reason to know it."</p>

<p>"What! you have reason to know it!" said a gentleman
who was not very old, for he would have passed for fifty,
who came in at that moment.</p>

<p>It was Don Enrique Valero, also a magistrate of the
Court, a man of an agreeable presence, with a fine
expressive face, albeit somewhat marked by the fast life he
had lived. As shown by his strong accent, which was
mincing and lisping, he was Andalusian, of the province of
Malaga.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know that," returned Saleta, calmly, "but
I perfectly well know the history of my country, and the
particulars regarding my family."</p>

<p>"And why do you mention your family in connection
with the Suevi, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Because, according to various documents preserved in
my ancestral archives, my family is descended from one of<a name="Page_016" id="Page_016"></a>
those brave commanders, who penetrated Pontevedra at the
time of the invasion."</p>

<p>The players exchanged an amused smile of intelligence
with Valero.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the latter between amusement and
irritation, "so my friend is a Sueve like a cathedral! Who
would have thought it to see him so dwarfish and so small!"</p>

<p>"Yes, señor," said the other, speaking with firmness and
deliberation as if he had not heard the last remark. "The
captain to whom our family owes its origin was named
Rechila. He was a man of ferocious and bloodthirsty
presence, a great conqueror, who extended his dominions
immensely, and, from what I understand, his expeditions
took him as far as Estremadura. One day, when I was a
child, a crown was found buried in the foundations of the
old chapel of our house."</p>

<p>"Really, my man, really!" exclaimed Valero, looking at
him with such comic indignation that all the others burst
out laughing.</p>

<p>But Saleta, quite unperturbed, went on to describe the
treasure-trove, its form, weight, and all its embellishments,
without omitting a single detail.</p>

<p>And Valero, without taking his eyes off him, continued
shaking his head with increasing irritation.</p>

<p>The same thing went on every night. His colleague's
unblushing lying propensity aroused in the magistrate an
indignation that was sometimes real, and sometimes feigned.
It was so seldom that a Galician dared to boast and
exaggerate before an Andalusian, that he, wounded in his
<i>amour propre</i> and respect for his country, sometimes
wondered whether Saleta was a fool, or whether he
considered his audience as such.</p>

<p>Really the magistrate of Pontevedra lied with so much
ease, and in such a serious way, that it became a question
whether he was an artful rogue, who delighted to upset his
friends.<a name="Page_017" id="Page_017"></a></p>

<p>"Did you say that this ancestor of yours got to
Estremadura?" asked Valero at last in a decided tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, Señor."</p>

<p>"Then it seems to me you make a mistake, for this
Señor Renchila&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rechila."</p>

<p>"Well, this Rechila got farther still, for he got as far as the
province of Malaga; but there a company of Vandals went
out to meet him: the leader was one of my ancestors. His
name is difficult to recollect&mdash;wait a bit, he was called
Matalaoza. Well, then, this Matalaoza, who was a rough,
brave sort of fellow, completely routed him, took him
prisoner, and kept him drawing water from a well till his
death. And a piece of the machine is still to be seen in
the cellar of our house."</p>

<p>Don Pedro, Jaime Moro, and the Conde de Onis
stopped playing, and roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"It cannot be so. Rechila never went farther than
Merida, which he took after a short siege," said Saleta, not
one whit put out.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, friend, in the archives of my house there
are documents which show that this Señor Renchila took a
company of soldiers through the province of Malaga, and
that the Señor Matalaoza, my grandfather on my mother's
side, prevented his advancing any farther."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, friend Valero, but it seems to me you are
in error. This Rechila must be another one; there were
many Rechilas among the Suevi."</p>

<p>"No, sir, no, the Rechila that my ancestor conquered
was an ancestor of yours; I am certain of it. He came
from the province of Pontevedra; that was clear from his
accent."</p>

<p>These remarks were made with great gravity, and the
players were more and more amused. As Saleta was
accustomed to his companion's chaff, he was not the least
put out, neither would he modify any of his boasting<a name="Page_018" id="Page_018"></a>
assertions. The man was perfectly shameless in the way
he invented lies and then stuck to them.</p>

<p>When he saw it was useless to discuss the matter farther,
he turned his attention to the game, and the others did the
same, although they could not repress an occasional
chuckle of amusement.</p>

<p>Jaime Moro went on winning, and he was cheerful and
talkative, making tedious remarks at every turn of the
game. He was a good-looking young fellow, with a short
black beard, regular features, large expressionless eyes, and
a delicate pink complexion. His father, who had been
parochial administrator of the province, had died the
previous year, leaving him an income, according to report,
of between 70,000 and 80,000 reales,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and this money gave
him a certain position in the place. Needless to say, he
was considered a prize in the matrimonial market, and he
was the golden dream, and the ideal of the girls, who contemplated
marriage; but unfortunately Moro was little
attracted by the opposite sex. He liked Mercury much
better than Venus; and indeed he was so fond of every
kind of game, that one might almost say he was born to
play, for his whole life was devoted to it.</p>

<p>He lived alone with his housekeeper, man-servant, and
cook. He got up between ten and eleven in the morning,
and after making his toilette he repaired to the confectioner's
shop of Doña Romana, where he found congenial spirits,
who told him all the current gossip of the place, and when
this was exhausted, he withdrew to the dark, greasy-looking
little room, pervaded by an overpowering smell of pastry,
at the back of the shop, and there seating himself at a table,
which matched its surroundings in dinginess, he indulged in
a glass of sherry, and a game of dominoes with Don Baltasar
Reinoso, who was one of the many who lived in Lancia
on an income of four or five thousand pesetas. At three<a name="Page_019" id="Page_019"></a>
o'clock he repaired to the Mercantile Club, where, with
three of the Indians, who formed the nucleus of that social
gathering, he indulged in the classic game of <i>chapo</i><a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> until
five o'clock, when, if we went to the house of the dean of
the cathedral, we should come across this gentleman enjoying
his daily game of <i>tresillo</i> with the dignitary of the
church, and the rector of San Rafael. When the <i>chapo</i>
went on longer than usual, an acolyte appeared at the club
to tell him that his friends were waiting. Then Moro
hastened to give the three or four final strokes, the boy,
between them, helping him on with his coat to save time;
then, after paying or receiving the balance of his account
with trembling hands, he ran in breathless haste to the
house of the dean. There the <i>tresillo</i> lasted till eight
o'clock. Then home to supper. At nine he repaired to
Don Pedro Quiñone's house to spend an hour or two in
the same sort of way, and if he did not go there, he went to
Don Juan Estrada-Rosa's for the same thing; and at
twelve to the Casino, where a few night-birds met for a
game of <i>monte</i>, or lottery. Finally Jaime Moro retired to
rest at two or three in the morning, quite tired out with
such a hard day's work, to wake to another exactly the
same.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that he was a covetous young
man, for the whole town knew, and lauded his liberality.
He was not incited to play by a passion for gain, but by
a devotion to the pastime, which extinguished all better
feelings.</p>

<p>His was an excessively active temperament, without the
intelligence or the wish for any serious aim in life. In his
short moments of idleness he looked like a quiet, careless,
lymphatic man, but directly he had the cards, billiard-cue,
or dominoes in his hand, he evinced an interest which utterly
changed his expression, as his eyes brightened and his hands
showed more power.<a name="Page_020" id="Page_020"></a></p>

<p>He was a universal favourite, and there never was a man
more suave and gentle in manner. He was never heard to
speak ill of anybody, and those who see only the dark side
of things and the weak point of people's characters, said
that he never grumbled because he did not know how to,
and that he was as good as he was, because he could not
be otherwise. But there must always be some perverse
fools!</p>

<p>However, Moro had one fault, begotten of his playing
propensity, he considered he was invincible in every game.
It could not be denied that he was a great expert at them,
but there is a great difference between that, and being
utterly unrivalled, which was the case with Moro. This
gave rise to those tedious, eternal commentaries, which
seasoned every game, until they became quite a byword in
Lancia.</p>

<p>When, after making a stroke on the billiard-table, the
balls did not go as he wanted, he struck his head in
despair:</p>

<p>"A little less ball and mine would have gone into the
pocket! But I was obliged to strike well on the ball so
that the red ball should go down, because if the ball does
not go down, you know how it would be."</p>

<p>If things went according to his ideas, he did not mind
how much he lost; the money was nothing to him as long
as he saved his professional honour. He talked unceasingly,
making a running commentary upon every stroke
he made; and he went on just the same at cards. However,
he never blamed his companions, or lost his temper
when his plan of action was defeated. He certainly talked
incessantly, but it was always to explain or to palliate some
point in the game, and the eternal repetitions, delivered in
the same eloquent and persuasive tone, provoked a smile
from the onlookers.</p>

<p>"If I had only had a king then! If I had but had
another trump! I did not dare give the lead because I<a name="Page_021" id="Page_021"></a>
thought that Don Pedro&mdash;Why could not this three of
hearts have been three of diamonds? With the deuce of
spades this trick was once got."</p>

<p>He was a noisy fellow, but very polite and kind.</p>

<p>"I say, it is your play now, is it not?" said Valero to
our friend as he looked over the players' shoulders and had
a glance at their cards.</p>

<p>"Do you think that can be done?" said Moro, vacillating.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"There is too little of this and not enough of that,"
returned Moro, discreetly pointing at the cards with his
finger.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, nevertheless, I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, let us play," replied Moro, with his usual
politeness.</p>

<p>That game was lost. Moro gave a look at his companions,
and shrugged his shoulders; then as Valero
turned away, he said in a low tone:</p>

<p>"I did not want to vex Don Enrique, but I knew that
that play could not win."</p>

<p>And having thus vindicated his reputation, he was as
pleased as if he had won the game.</p>

<p>The Conde de Onis seemed absent when he came in,
and as time went on, he became more and more thoughtful
and gloomy; and he played so carelessly that his friends
called him to book several times.</p>

<p>"But, Conde, what has come to you?" said Don Pedro,
at last, "you seem so very preoccupied."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have actually trumped my trick," added
Valero, in distress.</p>

<p>Seeing himself thus taken to task, the count looked as
confused as if his companions had read his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Nothing particular is the matter with me," he replied;
and taking refuge in an innocent excuse, he added, "I am
only suffering from toothache."<a name="Page_022" id="Page_022"></a></p>

<p>"So the poor fellow is ill!" said Valero.</p>

<p>Whereupon they all began pitying him, and asking him
particulars about his complaint.</p>

<p>The count being now at his wit's end, answered the questions
at random.</p>

<p>"Well, for that pain, Señor Conde," said Saleta, "there
is no finer remedy than iron. You will find that it is so.
When I was a student I suffered dreadfully from my teeth.
I never dared have one drawn, but the landlord I had in
Santiago told me the best thing to do was to take a thread,
and tie one end to the tooth, and the other to the back of
the chair, so that it was gradually drawn out without any
pain. I sat myself in a chair, and when the tooth was well
tied I got up from the chair and left it hanging behind me.
You see I had nothing to do but jump up."</p>

<p>Valero shook his head in despair, and the others looked
at him and smiled. But Saleta did not notice, or pretended
not to notice it, and continued his story in the quiet matter-of-fact
way and the strong Galician accent peculiar to him.</p>

<p>"Afterwards I quite overcame my fear of tooth-drawing.
The dentist of Corunna extracted five, one after the other;
and when I was judge at Allariz I was in dreadful pain,
and as there was no dentist the <i>Promotor</i><a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> pulled out three
for me with his wife's curling tongs; but do you know this
gave me inflammation of the mouth? I was then at Madrid,
and Ludovisi, the queen's dentist, burnt my gums with a red-hot
iron, and then extracted seven good teeth."</p>

<p>"There went fifteen!" murmured Valero.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I had no further trouble until four years ago,
when, whilst I was staying with a friend in a little place in
the province of Burgos, the pain came on again. There
was no doctor, no surgeon, nobody. But a charlatan
happened to come along who extracted teeth whilst on
horseback; and I was in such distress that I was obliged<a name="Page_023" id="Page_023"></a>
to have recourse to him, and he took out two with the tail
end of a spoon."</p>

<p>"Oh! my man, what humbug!" exclaimed Valero in
utter indignation, "and may I ask if you have a tooth left
in your head?"</p>

<p>Manin at this moment, with his usual want of manners,
opened his mouth wide with a loud guffaw, to the astonishment
of the party. Then the great giant turned round in
his chair and composed himself to sleep.</p>

<p>"You have never suffered from your teeth, have you,
Manin?" asked the Grandee, who could not be a quarter
of an hour without appealing to his majordomo.</p>

<p>"What?" asked the fellow without opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"He is like a rock!" said the nobleman with real
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Then Manin sat up a little, and rubbing his eyes with
his fists, he said:</p>

<p>"I never had anything worse than a stomach-ache: It
came on as I was loading a cart with hay, and it lasted
more than a month. I could not touch a morsel of food,
and it was just as if I had a fox continually gnawing
at my inside. My ribs felt as if they would break in
agony, and I leant against the wall, bowed down with pain,
and showed my teeth like a serpent. I became as yellow
as corn in harvest time. One day the señor priest said to
me: 'Manin, you have no heart.' 'I have no heart, señor
curé!' said I. 'You don't know me well if you say that,
for it is beating here for its very life. I have more heart
than what you would think!' 'Then there is nothing to
be done, Manin, but to send for the doctor,' said he. 'No,
indeed, señor curé; I want none of their drugs and plaisters.'
'Well, if you don't send for him, I shall,' was his answer.
At last there was no help for it, and although I was still
against it, Don Rafael, the doctor of the mines, arrived.
He made me undress as far as my shirt, and then forced
me by the shoulders on to a trough. Then he set to<a name="Page_024" id="Page_024"></a>
giving me blows on the chest with his knuckles, as if
he were knocking at a door. He thumped me here, and he
thumped me there, and listened with his ear pressed against
my body. 'Nay,' I cried. 'Gently! gently my good
fellow! Find the truant!' And he went on for half an
hour longer, knocking with his knuckles and listening with
his ear. At last he got tired of hearing nothing. 'Ah! friend
of my soul!' he said, making the sign of the cross, 'you
have a liquid heart. I never saw anything like it in my
life!' 'Yes, I knew that before, Don Rafael,' said I."</p>

<p>Having got so far in his relation, Manin stopped suddenly,
turned an angry glance on the audience, and muttered
under his breath: "And what do these asses find to laugh
at?"</p>

<p>Then, throwing his shaggy head back in the armchair, he
closed his eyes in great disgust.</p>

<p>The Grandee's guests resumed their game, laughing all
the while, but the count became more and more thoughtful
and absent.</p>

<p>At last no longer able to control his upset state of nerves,
he rose from his seat saying:</p>

<p>"I say, Don Enrique, will you kindly take my place;
this pain is so tiresome that I must move about?"<a name="Page_025" id="Page_025"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="head">THE DISCOVERY</p>


<p class="nind">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> the count went back to the drawing-room, he found
the young people preparing for a <i>rigodon</i> (a country
dance). The seat at the piano was occupied by one of the
daughters of the <i>Pensioner</i>; for such was the name given
in the town to Don Cristobal Mateo, as he was an old
government official, who, after serving many years in the
Philippines, had retired some time ago on an income of
30,000 reales.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>He had a military bearing and quite a martial aspect, with
his white moustache, large rolling eyes, thick eyebrows, and
powerful hands. Nevertheless, there was not a kinder man
in the Spanish dominions. His career had been cast in
Exchequer offices, and he always expressed strong opinions
against the power of the army. He maintained that the
blood-suckers of the State were not those employed in civil
functions, but the army and navy. The fact was demonstrated
by the production of figures and notes on the subject,
when he would quite lose himself in bureaucratic divagations.
He said that war was caused by the thirst for blood
emanating from the superfluous energy of the nation. This
was a phrase he had read in the <i>Boletin de Contribuciones
Indirectas</i> and appropriated as his own with marked effect.
He said soldiers were vagrants, and his aversion to all
uniforms and epaulettes was extreme. When the Corpora<a name="Page_026" id="Page_026"></a>tion
of Lancia talked of applying to the government for a
regiment to garrison the city, he, as councillor, opposed the
measure most resolutely.</p>

<p>What was the good of bringing a lot of spongers into the
neighbourhood? Instead of having the comfort of being at
some distance from a regiment, they would have all the disadvantages
of harbouring one. Everything would get dear,
for the colonels and officers liked to live well and have the
best of everything, "after all the hard work they did to earn
it," he added, ironically. Then they were all gamblers, and
their bad example would contaminate the youths of the
place, who never indulged in such licence except on times
of holiday making. As they were such an idle lot (Don
Cristobal firmly believed that a soldier had nothing to do),
one could imagine what a set of rogues they were! In
short, the regiment would be a corrupting element and a
source of disturbance in the place. So Mateo got his way,
not merely because it was his way, but because the Minister
of War did not consider it necessary to send soldiers to
Lancia, considering the peaceable condition of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>With his income of 30,000 reales, the Pensioner might have
lived very comfortably in such a cheap place, if his
daughters had not been possessed with the silly fancy of
preferring the hats of Madrid to those that were made by
the milliner of the Calle de Joaquin, and eight-button
gloves to four-button ones. Such superior tastes gave rise
in the Pensioner's house to many an upset, with all its
accompanying tears, hysterics, regrets, disinclination for
food, &amp;c. In these terrible conflicts it must be confessed
that Don Cristobal did not always comport himself with the
dignity, firmness and courage befitting his large moustachios
and strongly marked eyebrows. Certainly he was always
alone in the fray. Never by any chance did one of his
girls side with him, unless it was on a question apart
from the domestic arrangement of the house, when some<a name="Page_027" id="Page_027"></a>
of the daughters joined with papa against the others. But
whenever a problem of economy came to the fore, the
Pensioner was sure to have all four children against him.
Then Don Cristobal, like an experienced general, tried
every means to rout the enemy, or to capitulate under
fair terms.</p>

<p>One day the girls were suddenly seized with a fancy for
morocco-leather shoes like those of some young lady in the
town, who proved to be Fernanda Estrada-Rosa. Then
Don Cristobal became pensive and turned the matter over
in his mind, with the result of casually mentioning, in the
course of conversation at supper, that he had heard at <i>la
Innovadora</i> (the best bootmaker's) that morocco boots
were considered very dangerous in Lancia on account of the
damp; and that Don Nicanor, a local doctor happening to
be there at the time, observed that morocco was fatal in
such a cold rainy climate; in fact, catarrhs, sometimes developing
to galloping consumption, were frequently caught
from cold feet. But long before the poor old man finished
his diatribe against morocco, his daughters burst in with
such ironical laughter, and sarcastic speeches that he was
quite crushed.</p>

<p>Another time the girls were bent upon having parasols
from Madrid like Amalia's. Don Cristobal held out for
some time until finally, having the worst of it, he had to give
in. But fertile in resources like Ulysses, he conceived a
plan by which the expense would be halved. He went to
Amalia, and begged her to lend him her parasol for two or
three days, so that one of the local milliners could make
him four others exactly similar; and this, at his request, the
Señora de Quiñones promised to keep a solemn secret.
But the poor parasols were not up to the mark, and when
they arrived properly packed through the post, and ran
the gauntlet of the sharp, anxious eyes of his four daughters,
the old man was soon called to task for the poorness of the
trimmings and the coarseness of the work.<a name="Page_028" id="Page_028"></a></p>

<p>"These parasols were not made at Madrid!" said Micaela
in a tone of decision, for she was the sharpest of the four.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, don't be so absurd! Where then
do they come from?" returned Don Cristobal with
assumed surprise, whilst he felt the colour mount to his
face.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I am perfectly sure they were not
made in Madrid."</p>

<p>And the four nymphs turned them over, felt them with
their experienced fingers, and studied and analysed them so
minutely, that their father was plunged into a fearful state of
suspense. They exchanged significant glances, smiled
scornfully, and spoke in whispers. In the meanwhile the
Pensioner was a martyr to such an extreme state of nervous
anxiety that his very moustachios were affected.</p>

<p>At last the fanciful beings left the purchases in scornful
disdain upon the drawing-room chairs, and ran and locked
themselves in Jovita's room, where they remained half an
hour in secret conclave, whilst Don Cristobal waited in
anxious trepidation, as he walked up and down the corridor
like a criminal expecting his sentence.</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and the guilty creature stood
awaiting the verdict of the judges. But they maintained a
cautious reserve, whilst an enigmatical smile wreathed their
white lips. Then two of them put on their mantillas and
gloves, and darted into the street, to return in a short time
to the domestic hearth with blazing eyes, agitated faces, and
in a tremor of indignation.</p>

<p>The pen is powerless to portray the subsequent scene
in the Pensioner's peaceful dwelling. What cries of rage!
what bitter sarcasm! what hysterical laughter! what wringing
of hands! what banging of chairs! and what exclamations
of woe! And in the midst of such a scene, terrible
enough to strike terror into the heart of the most serene,
the four parasols, the innocent cause of all the fray, lay on
the ground in ignominious ruin.<a name="Page_029" id="Page_029"></a></p>

<p>With the exception of these periodical disturbances which
upset the somewhat weak nerves of the Pensioner, his
existence was very calm and peaceful, for the numberless,
but valuable, little attentions which make life pleasant
were never wanting. His daughters were careful about
having everything in order, and in its place. His shirts
and underclothing were kept in perfect order, his cravats,
made from old material, looked as fresh as if straight from
the hosiers, his slippers were always ready when he came
home, the water put for his foot-bath on Saturdays, his
cigar before going to bed, his glass of water with lemon for
his morning draught, &amp;c., all went on with the sweet and
regular mechanism so pleasing to the aged.</p>

<p>It was true that with four daughters it did not represent
much trouble, especially if they were not under the
dominion of some fancy or desire. But the sight of some
new-fashioned hat, the news of the arrival of a dramatic
company, or the announcement of some party at the Casino,
would be enough to cause the wildest excitement, in which
every other consideration went to the wall, and they were
seen flying off to the dressmaker, glove-shop, and perfumer.
As these wild freaks of fancy did not harmonise very well
with the prosaic details of existence, a slight disorganisation
ensued; but Don Cristobal bore these disturbances with
composure. After a short time of chaos, order returned,
and his life resumed its usual peaceful course. The names
of these daughters, in order of age, were as follows:
Jovita, Micaela, Socorro, and Emilita. In appearance,
they were four insignificant beings, neither beautiful nor
ugly, graceful nor ungraceful, young nor old, sad nor
vivacious. There was nothing remarkable in any one of
them, and yet by the domestic hearth the character of each
was quite distinct. Jovita was sentimental and reserved,
Michaela was quick tempered, and Emilita was the liveliest
of the party. Don Cristobal was greatly exercised on two
subjects, one was the reduction of the army and the other<a name="Page_030" id="Page_030"></a>
was the marriage of his four daughters, or at least two of
them. The first project was in a fair way to success, for
political opinion inclined in its favour, but as for the other,
I am sorry to say that there seemed no likelihood of its
realisation. In spite of sacrificing many comforts to dress
expenses, and frequenting the promenades, and the
Quiñones' balls with a regularity deserving success, the
precious gifts of Hymen were not attained.</p>

<p>When some imprudent fellow ventured to pay them any
attention he was told that they would be quite grieved to
marry in their father's life, for it seemed cruel to think of
abandoning a poor old man, who loved them so dearly,
and had sacrificed so much for them; and these protestations
were followed by the warmest eulogy on their father's
character.</p>

<p>But the Pensioner was quite anxious to repudiate these too
filial sentiments, and his desire of experiencing the cruelty
of being abandoned was so evident that it was quite a joke.
As if the daughters did not make themselves sufficiently
ridiculous, Mateo made the situation worse by throwing
them at the heads of all the marriageable young men of the
town.</p>

<p>But the praises sung by the old man on the cleverness,
economy, and good management of his daughters, were all
without effect. Directly a stranger arrived at Lancia, Don
Cristobal took care to strike up an acquaintance with him.
He invited him to coffee at his house, took him to his box
at the theatre, showed him the beauties of the surrounding
country, went with him to see the reliques of the cathedral,
visited the natural history museum, and, in short, did all the
honours of the place.</p>

<p>People smiled at the little play which had been acted so
many times without success, for Jovita was the only one
who arrived at the dignity of having a lover for three or
four years, which fact made her feel far superior to her
sisters. The young man had been a foreign student who<a name="Page_031" id="Page_031"></a>
had courted her during the latter courses of his studies;
but when they were over, he returned to his country, and,
forgetting his engagement to Jovita, he there married a
lady of property. The others never even attained to this
degree of love-making, they never got farther than fancies,
or flirtations of a fortnight's duration. Trifling attentions
were paid, but nothing serious ensued.</p>

<p>By degrees the girls assumed a colder demeanour, for
although they had not given up hope, they were tired, and
the one all-absorbing idea made a line of care on their
brows. But Cristobal did not think of giving in. He
firmly believed in the husbands of his daughters, and he
propounded the fact with as much assurance as the
prophets of the Old Testament announced the coming of
the Messias.</p>

<p>"When my daughters marry," he would say, "instead of
spending the summer in Sarrió, where the etiquette is as
strict as in Lancia, I shall go to Rodillero to breathe the
fresh air and fish for perch. Listen to me, Micaela; don't
be so sharp, woman. You will find a husband won't put up
with those frivolous ways; he will expect to be answered in
a proper manner."</p>

<p>"My husband will have to put up with what he can get,"
returned the pert girl, with a disdainful toss of her head.</p>

<p>"And if he gets tired of that?" asked Emilita, mischievously.</p>

<p>"He will have double work then, for he will get tired,
and get tired of getting tired."</p>

<p>"And suppose he took the stick to you?"</p>

<p>"He would have to be careful, for I should be quite
equal to poisoning him."</p>

<p>"Goodness! what a horror!" exclaimed the three nereids,
laughing.</p>

<p>So that hypothetical husband, that abstract being, figured
as constantly in conversation as if he were of flesh and
blood, and lived in the next house.<a name="Page_032" id="Page_032"></a></p>

<p>The daughter now playing the piano was Emilita, the
most musical of the four sisters. The other three were
standing, each hanging on the arm of a young man.</p>

<p>The count crossed the room to Fernanda-Rosa, who was
arm-in-arm with a girl friend. She did not seem to care
for the dancing, albeit she was a young lady renowned in
the town for her beauty, elegance, and fortune. She was
the only daughter of Don Juan Estrada-Rosa, the richest
banker and merchant of the province. Tall, moderately
stout, with a dark complexion, regular, striking features,
large, very black, scornful looking eyes, and a graceful
figure, embellished by the elegant toilettes, that were the
despair and envy of all the girls of the town, she did not
look as if she belonged to the place, but as if she had been
transported from one of the most aristocratic court <i>salons</i>.</p>

<p>"How charming you are looking, Fernanda!" exclaimed
the count, in a low voice, with a bow of admiration.</p>

<p>The beauty scarcely deigned to smile, but made a little
scornful pout.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Luis?" she said, giving him her hand
with marked displeasure.</p>

<p>"Not so well as you are, but I am pretty well."</p>

<p>"Only pretty well? I am sorry. I am perfectly well&mdash;you
have not forgotten me, then?" she returned in the
same displeased tone, without looking him in the face.</p>

<p>"Why, no, how could one forget the star Sirius?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand astronomy."</p>

<p>"Sirius is the most brilliant star in the heavens, everybody
knows that."</p>

<p>"Well then I did not know it. You see how ignorant
I am."</p>

<p>"I certainly do not; but you have modesty united to
beauty and talent."</p>

<p>"No, I know I have no talent, but you do not like to tell
me so."</p>

<p>"My girl, I have but just told you the contrary."<a name="Page_033" id="Page_033"></a></p>

<p>There was a touch of bitterness in the displeased tone of
Fernanda, whilst that of the count was calm and ceremonious,
although slightly dashed with irony.</p>

<p>"Very well, then I have misunderstood you."</p>

<p>"That is what you always do."</p>

<p>"Caramba, how polite!" exclaimed the young girl,
growing pale.</p>

<p>"You always think something disagreeable is meant,"
quickly added the count, as he saw by the change in her
face what idea had crossed her mind.</p>

<p>"Many thanks. I take your words for what they are
worth."</p>

<p>"You will be wrong in not thinking them sincere. Besides,
there is no need my telling you how worthy you are of
admiration, for everybody knows it."</p>

<p>"Thank you; thank you! So you are tired of playing?"</p>

<p>"My teeth hurt me a little."</p>

<p>"Have them out."</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Those that hurt you, man. Ave Maria!"</p>

<p>"With what indifference you say it. I suppose nothing
would affect you?"</p>

<p>"I am always affected by the sufferings of a neighbour."</p>

<p>"A neighbour! What a horror! I had not heard that I
was put in the category of neighbour."</p>

<p>"What do you want, sir? Honours come when least
expected."</p>

<p>In spite of the vexed, almost aggressive, tone of her voice,
Fernanda did not move away, but stood holding the arm of
the little friend, who never opened her lips. The rich heiress
was evidently very nervous. She gave little taps on the
ground with her foot, crushed up her handkerchief in her
hand, her lips trembled almost imperceptibly, and round her
dark Arab-looking eyes there was a paler circle than usual.
The argument evidently interested her.<a name="Page_034" id="Page_034"></a></p>

<p>Her engagement with the Conde de Onis had lasted
longer than any previous one.</p>

<p>When Fernanda first appeared in society, and earlier still,
when she was a little maiden going to school with a servant,
her figure, her elegance, and, above all, the six millions she
was to inherit, created quite a sensation. There was not a
youth with any pretensions to manners or money, who did
not determine, either of his own accord, or at the instigation
of his family, to walk down the street with her, send her
little notes, and whisper pleasant nothings in her ear.</p>

<p>De Sarrió, de Nueva, and other places also furnished
admirers, who came under the pretext of taking a holiday.
The girl, pleased and intoxicated with the incense of admiration,
never thought of keeping faith with anybody, for she was
continually breaking one engagement and entering into
another. A young man seldom remained in her good graces
more than a couple of months. In fact, there was no one
in a position to marry her, and in Lancia and the rest of
the province, there was nobody possessed of property equal
to her <i>dot</i>. If, perchance, such a one existed, he was not of
fitting age to enter into matrimony with such a young girl,
for he would be some Indian worn out by tropical heat, or
the elderly owner of some remote, grand, country mansion.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for her father to mention the matter,
for the girl perfectly understood that there was no one to
suit her; but she enjoyed flirting all round and making the
youths of Lancia adore her. There was one young man,
however, whom no girl of the town had ever dared to think
of marrying, and that was the Conde de Onis. He was
deeply respected on account of his old family in the province,
where the abject worship of aristocracy sinks the
burgess beneath the level of the servant and the agricultural
labourer; and his retired style of life and the mystery and
silence of his old palace, added to his handsome income,
seemed to exalt him to an atmosphere aloof from the darts
of all the local beauties.<a name="Page_035" id="Page_035"></a></p>

<p>But it was for this very reason, that there arose in
Fernanda's bosom a desire, at first vague, and then strong,
and overwhelming, to make a conquest of him. This is a
very natural wish, and being especially a feminine one, it
requires no explanation. In the bottom of her heart the
daughter of Estrada-Rosa felt herself inferior to the Conde
de Onis. Nevertheless, she had heard so much flattery;
and the glitter of her father's money seemed so irresistible,
that she thought she could well aspire to making him her
husband. If she did not really think so, she pretended to
do so when speaking of the count behind his back, and
affecting a certain familiarity in his presence.</p>

<p>In Lancia, as in all the little capitals, the young men and
women adopt the fashion of <i>tutoyant</i> each other, and this
was authorised from their having known each other and
played together as children. But for a long time the Conde
de Onis never exchanged a word with Fernanda, although
they constantly met in the street. Nevertheless, when they
first met at a little party at the De Meré's, the young beauty
immediately addressed him as <i>tu</i>, and dropped his title.
It was Luis here, and Luis there, as if she were quite
accustomed to his name. The count was surprised without
being displeased. No one is sorry to find himself
<i>tutoyé</i> by a lovely girl, and a naturally shy and timid man,
like the count, was not likely to be the exception.</p>

<p>Fernanda at once tried to enlist him as an admirer, or at
least to make him appear as such in the eyes of the public,
who looked upon it as a proper state of things. There was
no other husband for Fernanda, and no other wife for the
count in the province.</p>

<p>The distance that separated them was retrospective: it
existed only in Fernanda's lack of ancestors, and it was
generally thought that the young girl's beauty, money, and
brilliant education, would make the count overlook this
drawback.</p>

<p>These relations lasted about a year.<a name="Page_036" id="Page_036"></a></p>

<p>The two met at a party of the Señoritas de Meré, which
was always considered a pleasant occasion. She had often
hinted to the count that he might go to that house, but he
had either not understood, or pretended not to understand
her. But one day Fernanda openly made the suggestion.
He tried to get out of it as well as he could. Was he
timid? or was he proud? Fernanda could not make him
out; however, this reserve increased his attraction for her,
and made her like him all the more. But suddenly, when
the public least expected it&mdash;when, in fact, it had begun to
ask the reason of the delay of the marriage, the engagement
was broken off. It was done diplomatically and secretly,
so much so that it had been over for a month, and yet
people were still joking them, not knowing there had been
a break. The fact when revealed, produced a great
sensation, and became the subject of ceaseless conversation
at all the parties. No one could say what had
happened, or who had given the initiative in the matter.
If the count was asked, he stoutly maintained that
Fernanda had given him up; and so much stress did he lay
upon the statement, that nobody doubted his sincerity.
The heiress, Estrada-Rosa, corroborated her lover's
assertion without going into particulars, and this in the
off-hand tone she always adopted when speaking of, or to,
the count, for they went on seeing each other pretty
frequently, albeit not quite so often, although they attended
parties at the houses of mutual friends. Moreover, Fernanda
soon after became an <i>habituée</i> at the dances at the
Quiñones' house. But the past relations were never
renewed, and when the two former lovers met and talked a
little as now, the guests looked on with bated breath and
interested eyes.</p>

<p>"They will go on as before; they will end by marrying!"
they thought.</p>

<p>But they were disillusioned at the sight of the indifference
with which they parted.<a name="Page_037" id="Page_037"></a></p>

<p>Just as he was going to reply to the last words of the
proud heiress, the glance of the count wandered absently
round the room and fell upon a pair of eyes fixed upon
him with a sharp and jealous gaze, whereupon he gave his
hand to his friend and said with a forced smile:</p>

<p>"How badly you treat me, Fernanda! It will ever be
so, I suppose, but I, you know, am always your devoted
admirer. <i>Au revoir.</i>"</p>

<p>"I am sorry that this devotion neither pleases nor
displeases me," she returned, without moving a step
away.</p>

<p>Then the count went off shrugging his shoulders
resignedly and saying:</p>

<p>"And I am still more sorry."</p>

<p>Passing by the couples, who had commenced the <i>rigodon</i>,
he returned to the lady of the house, who was at that
moment with Manuel Antonio, one of the persons most
worthy of note in this period we are recording.</p>

<p>He was known as much by the nickname of the
Chatterbox, or Magpie, as by his own name. This fact is
sufficient to give us an idea of his moral and physical
characteristics.</p>

<p>Manuel Antonio was not young&mdash;he was certainly fifty;
and all the artificial means not distinguished for refinement,
then in vogue in Lancia, were brought into play to hide
the fact.</p>

<p>He had an unmistakable wig, several false teeth badly
put in, a little black on his eyebrows and red on his lips;
there was a strong scent of patchouli about him, and there
was a dash of originality in his whole get-up befitting his
reputation for former splendour. He really had been a
rare combination of face and figure: tall, slender, and
well-built, with regular delicate features, fine auburn hair
falling in graceful curls, a smiling countenance, and gentle
voice. There now only remained a faint trace of all this
beauty. The straight shoulders had become bent, the<a name="Page_038" id="Page_038"></a>
beautiful curls had vanished like a dream that was past;
unwelcome wrinkles furrowed the smooth brow; and the
rows of pearly teeth, so ornamental to his mouth, were
substituted by ugly gaps which time had made, and the
dentist had failed to replace satisfactorily. Finally, his
slight, delicate, silky moustache had become white, bristly,
and shaggy, and neither dye nor cosmetic could keep it
presentable.</p>

<p>What a trial this was for the handsome young man of
Lancia and for the friends who had known him in the
palmy days of his beauty! But his mind kept as youthful
as when he was eighteen. He was the same impassioned,
affectionate creature, sweet one moment, irascible and
terrible another, following the bent of his caprices and
living in quiet idleness.</p>

<p>He enjoyed the pleasures of the bath so intensely that he
would have it three or more times running, until the water
was as clear as when it left the spring. He loved flowers
and birds, but no delight equalled that of trying on different
articles of adornment before the glass to see which
suited him best. He considered that a dash of the
feminine made his costume more fetching, so in winter he
liked to wear a short cape with a gold clasp and a wide
brimmed hat which suited him to perfection. In summer
he dressed in white flannel, very well cut to show off the
graceful lines of his figure. His neckerchiefs were nearly
always of gauze, his shoes low, and the collar of his shirt
cut sailor fashion. On his wrist he wore a bracelet; it was
certainly only a bright gold band, but this detail caught the
eyes of all his fellow citizens. Whenever Manuel Antonio
was spoken of, the bracelet was sure to be mentioned, as if
there was nothing about his interesting person more calculated
to excite attention. But if years had not materially
changed this kind creature, so eminently created for love,
they had nevertheless made him more cautious and more
reserved. He did not show his preferences in the in<a name="Page_039" id="Page_039"></a>genuous
fashion of former years, and he did not give play
to the impulsive fancies of his susceptible heart until he
had proved the worthiness of the object of his affection.
Many were the disillusions he had suffered in his life, and
it was particularly sad when he was getting old to meet not
only coldness from his old friends, from those to whom he
had been lavish in marks of kindness, but to find that he
was an object of derision, in fact the laughing-stock of the
youths of the new generation. The young people of the
present day made a regular butt of him.</p>

<p>As they had not witnessed his triumphs, nor known his
past radiant beauty, they were far from professing that
respect that the last generation had had for him. They
never lost an opportunity of worrying and teasing him
cruelly. When he appeared in the Calle de Altavilla, or
entered the Café de Marañón, he was surrounded by a
crowd of <i>gamins</i>. Cristo! the remarks that were made;
and, sad to say, they passed from using their tongues to
using their hands. This was what Manuel Antonio could
not put up with. They could talk as much as they liked,
for he had the gift of repartee and could well hold his
own with his turn for sarcasm and his sense of the ridiculous;
and years, and long practice had made him such an
adept in this art of repartee, that his retorts were terrible;
and those who tried to get a rise out of him generally got
the worst of it, and were staggered by the words they
brought on themselves. But when these shameless fellows
passed from speech to touch, patting his face and pulling his
beard, he entirely lost his self-control, and gave vent to
expressions which were neither intentional nor rational.
Needless to say that as this was known to be his weak
point, the teasing always terminated in this way. Nevertheless,
apart from the pardonable desire to retort on those
who hurt him, he was not naturally malignant, but really a
most useful and serviceable being. His talents were many,
and various. He could crochet most perfectly, and his<a name="Page_040" id="Page_040"></a>
coverlets were unrivalled in Lancia. He decked an altar,
or dressed the images as well as any sacristan. He could
upholster furniture, make wax flowers, paper walls, embroider
with hair, and paint plates. And when any of his
female friends wished to have her hair well dressed to go
to some ball, Manuel Antonio gallantly went to the rescue,
and did it as cleverly as the best hairdresser in Madrid.
If any of his friends were ill, then was the time to see the
unfailing care and attention of our old Narcissus. He
immediately took up his post by the sick bed, he kept
count of the draughts, made the bed, and put on poultices
as cleverly as the most practised nurse. Then, if the illness
became serious, he knew how to suggest the idea of confession
with so much tact, that instead of the patient being
offended, he accepted it as the most natural thing in the
world. And when he saw that death was imminent, he
prepared for the reception of the solemn guest, and no lady
could have taken greater pains to receive some most important
personage:</p>

<p>There was the little altar with the embroidered cloth,
lighted with candles, the staircase adorned with pots of
flowers, the ground covered with rose-leaves, and the
servants and relations at the door, holding lighted tapers in
gloved hands. Not a single detail was forgotten. The Chatterbox,
in his glory, assumed the manners of a general at
the head of his troops. Everybody obeyed and seconded
him as if he were a chief. Then, if the patient died, it is
hardly necessary to say that his power was still more
omnipotent. From the laying-out of the corpse to the final
function of burial, there was nothing but what he had a
hand in. And as there were generally sick people to nurse,
images to dress, friends who wanted their hair dressed, or
flowers to be arranged, Manuel had rather a busy life. In
performing these offices, or in going from house to house
fetching and carrying news, the days and years slipped by.
He lived with two sisters, older than himself, and they<a name="Page_041" id="Page_041"></a>
looked after him, and cared for him as if he were still a
child. They paid no heed to their brother's wig, wrinkles,
or false teeth, and the hours he spent on his toilette, and
his baths provoked a compassionate smile. Whilst they
bitterly deplored the ravages made by time on their own
faces and figures, they seemed to think that their brother
had arrested the course of the common enemy, and that he
had in fact some elixir for keeping himself eternally young.
Manuel Antonio was methodical in his visits: he had
several houses at which he called every day at the same
time. He went to Don Juan Estrada's at three o'clock, the
coffee hour; he took chocolate with the Countess of Onis
every afternoon, and he was a regular <i>habitué</i> at the evening
receptions of the Señora de Quiñones. There were several
other families that he frequently visited. He dropped into
the houses of Maria Josefa Hevia and the Mateos in the
morning for a little while, just to hear any news that was
going, or to inspect their work, and sometimes of an evening,
he went to the Señoritas de Meré.</p>

<p>"Look, here is the count!" he exclaimed in his peculiarly
effeminate tone. "Ah! what a cunning fellow the
count is!"</p>

<p>"How?" said the count, approaching.</p>

<p>"Ask Amalia."</p>

<p>Then the smile suddenly left the lips of the nobleman.</p>

<p>"What? What do you mean?" he exclaimed with undisguised
confusion.</p>

<p>Amalia also looked upset, and her pale cheeks grew
red.</p>

<p>"We have been grumbling at you, my man, and a pretty
character we gave you. Yes, Manuel Antonio has been
saying that you are a dog in the manger," said Amalia.</p>

<p>"No, you were the one who said so."</p>

<p>"I?" exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p>"And why am I the dog in the manger?" said the
count. "Let us hear."<a name="Page_042" id="Page_042"></a></p>

<p>"Because Amalia says you do not want to eat the meat
yourself, and you will not let Don Santos eat it."</p>

<p>"Get along! Hold your tongue, you rude fellow!" said
the lady half-laughing, giving him a pinch.</p>

<p>"What is being said of Don Santos?" asked a short,
broad gentleman, with a fat purple face, who approached
the group.</p>

<p>The count and Amalia did not know what to answer.</p>

<p>"They were remarking," said Manuel Antonio, with his
ready tongue, "that Don Santos thought of taking us up to
his place, the Castañeda (Chestnuts)."</p>

<p>"No, no, it was not that," returned the stout man with a
forced smile.</p>

<p>"Yes it was, and Amalia maintained that you were not
up to taking us to the Castañeda for the day."</p>

<p>"But, my good fellow, you seem bent on painting me in
very black colours," said Amalia.</p>

<p>"Because I am a real friend. How pale you have been
looking lately.... You must credit me, Santos, for having
a higher opinion of your generosity than the majority of
people. 'You don't know Don Santos,' I often say to those
who declare that you do not like spending money. 'If Don
Santos does not spend and does not entertain his friends, it
is not from avarice but from indolence, and from want of a
fitting occasion. The man is self-distrustful, and incapable
of proposing banquets or festivities; but let anybody start
the idea, and you will see how gladly it will be followed
up.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, Manuel Antonio," murmured
Don Santos, with a rabbit-like smile.</p>

<p>The poor man was indeed continually haunted by the
fear of appearing mean. Like many of the Indians, the
fact of his being immensely rich gave him a reputation, not
utterly unfounded, of being mean. He arrived a few
years ago from Cuba, where by dint of first packing cases
with sugar and then selling them, he amassed an immense<a name="Page_043" id="Page_043"></a>
fortune. He was like a Bedouin, without any regard for
what went on in the world; he could not speak a dozen
words correctly, nor comport himself like other men. The
thirty years he had spent behind a counter had caused his
legs to swell, which had given him the gait of a drunken
man. The high colour of his complexion was so characteristic,
that in Lancia, where few people escaped a nickname,
he was dubbed <i>Garnet</i>.</p>

<p>In the midst of his misery he enjoyed making some show
with his riches. He built a most magnificent house: the
steps were of marble from Carrara, the furniture from Paris,
&amp;c. Nevertheless, when he came to pay the large bills
contracted in its construction, he was careful to see what
could be taken off for the value of the paper and cord, used
for packing the things for their transit from Paris. With this
object in view, he would carefully examine these wrappings
accumulated in a heap in a corner. When the house was
finished, he took possession of the ground-floor, and let the
other two. And then began his martyrdom&mdash;a martyrdom
long and terrible. The servants and children of the second
and third floors were his torturers. If he heard the floors
of the second storey being rubbed, he was put in a bad
humour, for he said that sand was bad for boarded floors.
If he saw a mark made on the stucco by the careless hand
of some little child, he was very angry and muttered words
of dread import. If he heard a door shut violently, the
sound seemed to go to his heart, and fears filled his mind
lest the hinges should be loosened, and the bolts displaced.
At last the continual excitement threw him into such a highly
nervous state that his health visibly declined. A friend of
his, who was quite as miserable, although endowed with
more spirit, suggested that he should leave the house and
live in another one. And so he did, for he returned to the
hotel where he had put up during the building of his palace.</p>

<p>But Santos was remiss in the performance of the duty
considered incumbent on all those who make large fortunes<a name="Page_044" id="Page_044"></a>
from the sugar trade in America&mdash;he failed to enter into
matrimony with any lady, young or old, pretty or ugly.</p>

<p>None of his friends ever took a tradesman's daughter for
a wife, and Garnet could not do less than they. On the contrary,
as he was richer than any of them, it was natural that
he should expect more social advantages. And so it came
about that he fixed his prominent, bloodshot eyes upon the
prettiest, richest, and most charming girl in the town&mdash;on
nobody less than Fernanda Rosa. The fact aroused the
astonishment and derision of the neighbourhood. For highly
as money was esteemed in Lancia, it was not thought equal
to the accomplishment of a feat like this. The pride of the
province marry a fellow of his caste! The girl was angry
and indignant. At first she considered it a joke; then she
became annoyed, and finally she ridiculed the idea. At last
she became used to Garnet's attentions, and it pleased her
self-love to be a subject of adulation, which she unmercifully
snubbed in return. But Santos was pertinacious in his courtship.
With the persistence of a fly which dashes against
glass, trying a hundred times to pass through the obstruction,
neither repulses, ridicule, nor rude remarks rebuffed
him for long. He returned the next day, metaphorically
speaking, to break his head against the cold disdain of the
proud heiress. He really thought that the real obstacle to
the realisation of his hopes was the Conde de Onis. He
acknowledged that Fernanda was somewhat attracted to
him, or, as he thought, to his title, and he seriously considered
going to Madrid to buy one of the same rank as
that of his rival. But when he was told that the papa set
no store by such things, he gave up the idea. In the meanwhile,
he vowed revenge on the gallant count, and hated
him with a deadly hatred, which he showed by never losing
an opportunity of making fun of his ugly, old-fashioned,
dilapidated house. The count was rich in land, but his
income could not be compared with that of the opulent
Garnet.<a name="Page_045" id="Page_045"></a></p>

<p>"And if not, you will see the day that he marries what a
change will be effected in the place," continued Manuel
Antonio; "we shall have banquets, and balls, and <i>fêtes
champêtres</i> every day."</p>

<p>"But suppose Fernanda does not like balls?" said
Emilita Mateo, who was dancing with Paco Gomez, and
had her back to the group.</p>

<p>"I do not know that I have mentioned Fernanda," said
the Chatterbox severely.</p>

<p>"I thought you were talking of Don Santos marrying, and
I supposed you meant with her."</p>

<p>"Then do not suppose any more, but attend to your
dancing with Paco, for I reckon he has been waiting five
minutes."</p>

<p>Paco was a very slender young man, so tall that he
reached the lintels of the doorways, with a head about the
size of a potato, and such a thin face that he really only
seemed to walk about by permission of his undertaker.
And with these physical peculiarities, he was the wittiest
person of the place.</p>

<p>"Well, my child!" he exclaimed, standing in front of the
Chatterbox. "The only thing for which I should regret
dying would be to be deprived of the pleasure of seeing
such bewitching creatures as yourself."</p>

<p>With this he gave his beard a derisive sort of touch.</p>

<p>We know that Manuel Antonio could not bear anybody's
hands near him in public.</p>

<p>"Be off, you jackdaw, be off!" he returned, with visible
irritation as he pushed him away.</p>

<p>"But are you not fetching? Why, my man, if this were
lost to view! Look what a mouth! Goodness alive, what
shaped eyes! Did you ever see such a texture of the skin?"</p>

<p>And as he touched him again, Manuel repulsed him with
a hard push of real anger.</p>

<p>"Caramba! how cross you are to-day!" said the Conde
de Onis.<a name="Page_046" id="Page_046"></a></p>

<p>"It does not matter," returned Paco with a sigh, "white
hands never offend."</p>

<p>At that moment it was his turn to figure in the <i>rigodon</i>,
and he went off with Emilita.</p>

<p>Maria Josefa, who had been dancing a little way off, now
came up with her partner, a lieutenant of the battalion of
Pontevedra.</p>

<p>"Why, Don Santos, you are cruel! Why do you not go
and keep Fernanda company? She is quite alone."</p>

<p>This was true, for the little friend of the rich heiress
having found a partner for the dance, Fernanda was sitting
by herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you ought to go, Santos," said Manuel
Antonio; "see, the girl has left an empty chair by her side;
she could not give a stronger hint."</p>

<p>So saying, he winked at the count, who confirmed his
statement by saying: "I think it would only be polite."</p>

<p>Garnet cast a sharp glance at the speaker and surlily
returned:</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go yourself and sit by her
side?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason that we have nothing to talk
about. But with you it is quite different."</p>

<p>"That is understood, Señor Conde. I am not a child,"
he murmured very crossly.</p>

<p>"Although you are not a child in age," said Amalia,
intervening to prevent discord, "you are one in the frankness
and spontaneity of your sentiments, and in the freshness
of heart, that other people younger than you are
remiss in. Children love with more simplicity and fervour
than men."</p>

<p>"But men do something more heroic&mdash;they marry," said
Paco Gomez, who was again standing near with his
partner.</p>

<p>"There are occasions when they do not marry either,"
returned Manuel Antonio, making an imperceptible<a name="Page_047" id="Page_047"></a>
grimace, by which it could be seen that he was thinking of
Maria Josefa.</p>

<p>"Very well," returned that gentleman, abandoning the
argument; "but it must be allowed that there are cases
when such an act would require a heroism beyond human
nature."</p>

<p>The old maid who overheard this last remark, cast a
withering look at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Human nature, indeed!" she retorted with displeasure,
"human nature sometimes assumes such eccentric forms
that heroism would appear out of place."</p>

<p>However, Paco Gomez was not a whit confused, and
merely touched his face with comic gestures, feigning a
dumb submission, which made the others laugh. Amalia,
seeing the conversation was getting dangerous, changed the
subject by exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Look, see what Don Santos has been doing whilst we
have been busy talking!"</p>

<p>And, in fact, the Indian had quietly left his seat and
glided into a chair by Fernanda's side.</p>

<p>She glanced at him coldly, and hardly deigned to respond
to his ceremonious and pompous greeting. Nevertheless,
the red face of Garnet shone like that of a god
sure of his omnipotence. With his large, broad, fat hands
spread out on his knees, his body bent forwards, and his
head raised as much as the fat nape of his neck would
permit, he disclosed a row of large teeth as his lips
wreathed in a beneficent smile. Trying, according to his
wont, to make conversation, he said:</p>

<p>"Have you noticed in what quarter the wind is?"</p>

<p>The young lady made no reply.</p>

<p>"It does not signify now," he continued, "as all the
fruit is gathered in, but if it had come sooner, we should
not have had a chestnut nor a grain of maize left, he!
he!"</p>

<p>To judge from the expression of pleasure which shone<a name="Page_048" id="Page_048"></a>
in his eyes, Garnet delighted in giving utterance to this
remark.</p>

<p>"But it is not cold here, eh? I am not cold, he! he!
On the contrary I feel hot. It is because your eyes are two
coals&mdash;they are burn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another time he would have finished the word burning
without any hesitation, but to excuse his confusion, he
feigned a cough which made his purple face look as if he
were suffering strangulation.</p>

<p>The beauty, who had kept her eyes fixed on space, now
turned her head towards her adorer, and looked at him
with a vague, absent expression, as if she did not see him.
She then got up, and without vouchsafing a word, took a
seat a little way off. So the Indian was left with the same
stereotyped smile on his face, like the petrified grimace of a
satyr. But when he saw the eyes of the others fixed
derisively upon him, he suddenly became cross and
peevish.</p>

<p>"What has this Garnet to do with the ladies?" said Paco
Gomez to the count. "As I was saying the other day,
you do not need to go to America for rich women. Your
face is your fortune."</p>

<p>"Look, my dear count, you ought to go and sit by her side.
You will see she won't get up then," said Manuel Antonio.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you ought to go, Luis," said Maria Josefa,
"we shall be able to see then whether she is in love with
you or not. Really, Amalia, ought he not to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it seems to me that you ought to sit by her side,"
said the lady in measured, trembling tones.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked the count, looking earnestly
at her.</p>

<p>"Yes, go," returned the lady, with perfect serenity, avoiding
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Then you must allow me to disobey you, as I do not
wish to expose myself to a rebuff."</p>

<p>"What do rebuffs signify when you are in love?...<a name="Page_049" id="Page_049"></a>
Because from what I hear, you are in love with Fernanda.
It is known for a mile round."</p>

<p>"Certainly for a mile round, for that is not saying
much," interposed Manuel Antonio.</p>

<p>And Maria Josefa, and Emilita Mateo, and Paco Gomez
all corroborated the remark with a smile.</p>

<p>Amalia insisted effectually. Luis had tried his best to
avoid suspicion; but as all efforts are ineffectual to exclude
every ray of light, she had guessed for some time
past that the count nourished in the depths of his heart
an affectionate regard for Fernanda.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she said; "a few days ago somebody
happened to say to Moro that he had two false teeth.
You cannot think how put out the poor man was; a
little more and he would have beaten him who told him
of it."</p>

<p>"I am not as bad as that," said the count, "but I expressed
myself somewhat emphatically, as injustice always
annoys me," and he smiled shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"Oh! excitement in such cases is always suspicious.
When one feels no interest in anybody, one is not so vehement
in denying it. Caramba! I never saw you so put
out as you are now. One can see that the girl has a
valiant champion ready to break lances on her behalf."</p>

<p>The lady did not leave the joke. She seemed to wish the
count to think that his love for Fernanda was a foregone
conclusion. In spite of the kind smile on her face, there
were certain strange inflexions in her voice that were only
noticeable to one person present at that moment.</p>

<p>But the <i>rigodon</i> was over and the little group was
augmented by the arrival of several other couples. Some
came, and others went, until at last the lady found herself
surrounded by fresh people. Another waltz was danced,
and another. Then twelve o'clock struck from the
cathedral clock. And as the young people showed no sign
of dispersing, Manin, according to the custom of the house,<a name="Page_050" id="Page_050"></a>
appeared by Don Pedro's order at the drawing-room door
with an armful of wraps belonging to the ladies. This was
the signal for withdrawal adopted by the Señor de Quiñones
at his parties. It was not very courteous, but nobody
was offended; on the contrary, it was received in good
part and considered a pleasant sort of joke.</p>

<p>After they had all shaken hands with the Grandee, they
formed a group in the middle of the drawing-room, and
Amalia in the centre bade farewell to her female friends, as
she kissed them affectionately. She was pale, and her eyes
looked anxious and feverish as she gave her hand to the
count; she turned her head aside, feigning inattention;
but she pressed his fingers firmly three or four times as if to
inspire him with courage, for indeed the poor man was in
want of it. He was so nervous and trembling that Amalia
thought that he would collapse entirely.</p>

<p>And then the guests quickly passed into the passages
and down the damp stone staircase. A servant was there
to open the street-door.</p>

<p>"Ah! Who left this basket here?" said Emilita Mateo,
who was the first to come across the obstruction.</p>

<p>"A basket?" asked several ladies as they came up to
her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some poor creature asleep about here," said
the servant, who had not yet closed the door.</p>

<p>"There is nobody to be seen," said Manuel Antonio,
who had quickly surveyed the portico.</p>

<p>Curiosity then prompted one of the ladies to raise the
cloth which covered the basket. Whereupon the same
exclamation was heard that Pharaoh's daughter uttered
when she saw the celebrated basket of Moses floating on
the river.</p>

<p>"A child!"</p>

<p>Then ensued a moment of amazement and curiosity
among the guests. They all rushed forward, all wishing to
see the foundling at once. For no one doubted for an<a name="Page_051" id="Page_051"></a>
instant but that the child had been purposely left there.
Paco Gomez picked up the basket and uncovered it completely,
so as to show the sleeping child to his friends.</p>

<p>Then followed a storm of exclamations.</p>

<p>"Little angel! Who could have been so wicked?
Poor little soul! What stony-hearted creatures! Oh,
my goodness! Look how beautiful he is! Has he been
left in the cold long? The little thing must be perished.
Paco, let me touch it."</p>

<p>The basket was passed from hand to hand. The ladies,
who were very interested and trembling with emotion,
pressed so many tender kisses on the cheeks of the newly-born
that it was aroused from its sleep.</p>

<p>A feeble cry from the little pink creature filled every
heart with pity, and some of the ladies burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Let us take it upstairs so that it may be warmed a
little."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; let us take it upstairs."</p>

<p>And forthwith the chattering crowd rushed into the hall
and up the staircase of the mansion of the Quiñones, carrying
the mysterious basket in triumph.</p>

<p>Amalia was standing pale and motionless in the middle
of the drawing-room when the doors were re-opened. Don
Pedro had been taken to bed by Manin and another
servant. The fresh sudden invasion seemed a great surprise
to the lady of the house.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What is this?" she exclaimed, in
an agitated voice.</p>

<p>"A baby, a baby!" was the simultaneous cry of many
voices.</p>

<p>"We have just found it in the doorway," said Manuel
Antonio, putting down the basket which he had carried
upstairs.</p>

<p>"Who left it there?"</p>

<p>"We do not know. It is a foundling. Look! See how
beautiful it is, Amalia."<a name="Page_052" id="Page_052"></a></p>

<p>"Perhaps some poor person, who will come and fetch it,
just left it in the doorway."</p>

<p>"No, no; we have inspected the doorway, and the street
is deserted."</p>

<p>The little creature, who was disturbed by all this excitement,
now stretched out its two little rosebud fists, and the
compassion of the ladies was evinced in passionate exclamations.
Each one wished to kiss it and press it to her
bosom. At last Maria Josefa managed to get possession
of it, and taking it from the basket she tenderly wrapped it
in the cloak with which it had been covered, and pressed it
to her bosom. Then a paper which had been in the
child's clothes fell to the ground. Manuel Antonio picked
it up. On the paper was written in large awkward-looking
characters, evidently with the left hand: "The unhappy
mother of this baby girl commends her to the charity of the
Señores de Quiñones. It is not baptised."</p>

<p>"It is a girl, then!" exclaimed several ladies in one voice.</p>

<p>And in the tone of this remark it was evident that the
discovery was somewhat disappointing. They had been so
certain it was a boy.</p>

<p>"What mystery is this?" asked Manuel Antonio, whilst
a malicious smile curled his lip.</p>

<p>"Mystery? There is no mystery," returned Amalia with
some displeasure. "It is evidently some poor woman who
wants her child to be maintained."</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding, there is a <i>je ne sais quoi</i> strain of
mystery about the matter, and I would wager that the
parents of this baby are well-to-do," replied the Magpie.</p>

<p>"Well, now you are getting foolish!" exclaimed the
lady, with a nervous smile. "Well-to-do people do not
leave their children dressed in rags."</p>

<p>Certainly the baby was dressed in miserable clothes and
covered with a scanty, dirty cloak.</p>

<p>"Gently, Amalia, gently," interposed Saleta in his clear,
quiet voice. "Many years ago I found in the doorway of<a name="Page_053" id="Page_053"></a>
my house in Madrid a child enveloped in very old
clothes, and at the end of some time we ascertained that
he was the son of a very important personage, who shall be
nameless."</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned to the Galician magistrate in
surprise.</p>

<p>"It was a very important personage, it was&mdash;&mdash;" he
continued, after a pause, with the same cool impertinence:
"well, it was very easy to guess who it was; the features
of the face showed him to be a perfect Bourbon."</p>

<p>The audience was quite taken aback. They looked at
each other with the slightly amused smile prevalent on such
occasions, and Saleta was quite unconcerned.</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" exclaimed Valero; "won't you have your
umbrella?"</p>

<p>"The child died when he was two months old," continued
the imperturbable Saleta; "and it was a fact that when we
went to the cemetery, a carriage joined the funeral cortège,
and nobody knew to whom it belonged. But I knew it, for I
had seen it in the royal stables; however, I held my tongue."</p>

<p>"Will the babbler never cease?" murmured Valero.</p>

<p>"All right, Saleta; you must tell us this story by day, at
night such things are rather boring," said the Chatterbox intervening
and winking at the others. "What we have to
think of now, Amalia, is what is to be done with the baby."</p>

<p>The lady shrugged her shoulders with indifference.</p>

<p>"I don't know. We will leave her here to-night, and to-morrow
we will look for a nurse for her, for it is really quite
an upset."</p>

<p>"If you do not care about keeping her in the house, I
shall be very pleased to take charge of her, Amalia," said
Maria Josefa, who had stood a little apart cooing to the
baby to keep it quiet.</p>

<p>"I did not say that I did not wish to," returned the lady,
somewhat sharply. "I will take the child, because it
concerns me more than anybody, since it is confided to my<a name="Page_054" id="Page_054"></a>
care. But, as you can understand, before doing so I must
consult my husband."</p>

<p>The guests greeted these words with a murmur of approbation.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Manin appeared, to ask the meaning
of all the excitement. It was explained to him. Then the
Señor de Quiñones had himself brought back into the
drawing-room in his wheeled chair; and when he saw the
baby, he at once interested himself in her behalf.</p>

<p>He immediately declared she should not leave the house,
and he told a servant to find a nurse in the morning. In
the meanwhile the little creature had a little milk and tea in
a flask with an india-rubber top; and it was then enveloped
in better wraps. The guests watched these operations with
the keenest interest. The ladies uttered cries of enthusiasm,
and their eyes overflowed with tears when they saw the
eager way the baby sucked the top of the bottle.</p>

<p>When all was done, they said good-bye again; but they did
not leave without each one pressing a kiss on the cheeks of
the poor little foundling baby.</p>

<p>All this time the Conde de Onis did not open his lips.
He stood in the third or fourth row, following with eager
eyes all the attention and care bestowed upon the infant.
But when he was about to depart without again taking
leave, Amalia stopped him with an audacity which almost
petrified him.</p>

<p>"What is this, count? Do you not wish to kiss my
charge?"</p>

<p>"I, yes, Señora."</p>

<p>This was the finishing stroke. And pale and trembling
he approached, and put his lips on the little creature's
forehead, whilst the lady watched him with a provoking
triumphant smile.<a name="Page_055" id="Page_055"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="head">THE TOWN</p>


<p class="nind">T<span class="smcap">his</span> was the third night that the Conde de Onis could
hardly close his eyes. Nothing was more natural than that
he should be agitated and feverish the last two nights; but
now, wherefore? All had happened as it had been
arranged. The undertaking had succeeded well, he had
nothing to do but sleep on his triumph. But it was not so.
In spite of his strong robust figure, the Conde had an
excessively nervous and impressionable temperament. The
slightest emotion upset him and excited him to an
indescribable extent. Such intense sensibility was the
result of heredity as well as education. His father, Colonel
Campo, had been a self-centred sensitive man, of such keen
susceptibility that he was quite a martyr to it the last years
of his life. Everybody in Lancia recollected the interesting
touching episode which closed the life of the single-minded
gentleman.</p>

<p>The colonel had had to send forces to defend a place in
Peru during the insurrection of the American colonists; but
the place was taken by surprise in an underhand way. By a
false report the colonel was accused of treachery before the
Government at Madrid, it being asserted that he had been
in collusion with the enemy. With severe precipitancy,
without impartial evidence of the facts, and without taking
into consideration the Conde of Onis' brilliant career in the
Service, the king deprived him of his commission, and all
the crosses and decorations in his possession. The<a name="Page_056" id="Page_056"></a>
punctilious old soldier was completely crushed by this
unexpected blow. His comrades snatched the pistol from
him just when he attempted his life. Accompanied by a
faithful attendant, he left Madrid and came to Lancia, where
his wife and son of tender age were awaiting him. The
family life was a sedative for the wounded heart of the
soldier. But the brave man who had so often defied death,
had not the courage to face the curious eyes of his fellow-citizens.
Instead of rebelling against the injustice that had
been done him, instead of trying to convince his compatriots
of his innocence, which would not have been very
difficult, as they all esteemed his character, and knew his
bravery, he was so conscious of his disgrace that he
avoided the sight of people and retired to his house, and he
never walked farther than the garden at the back of the
house, bounded by high, crumbling walls.</p>

<p>The palace of the Counts of Onis deserves especial
mention in this story. It was a very old building; some
remains of the original edifice which were still extant,
were the oldest part of the town. Nothing else was
saved from the dreadful fire which destroyed the city in
the fourteenth century. It was more like a fortress than a
mansion. There were a few narrow windows fitted with
stone columns, scattered capriciously over the façade, a bare
stone wall blackened by time, with several square holes like
ventilators near the roof, and a large door in the middle
studded with heavy nails. Inside it was immense, and
more cheerful. The courtyard was broader than the street.</p>

<p>The sun came in at the window at the back at midday,
and its rays were tempered by the branches of the garden-trees
which formed a pleasant curtain.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of mystery and enchantment
about this old house for the Lancians, who were endowed
with imagination; more especially for the children, who are
the only beings who are open to weird fancies in this
prosaic age.<a name="Page_057" id="Page_057"></a></p>

<p>The façade, if such a name can be given to the
aforesaid wall, faced the Calle de la Misericordia, one of
the most central streets of the town.</p>

<p>One of the windows, perchance the largest, overlooked
the Calle de Cerrajerías, and from it could be seen the
cathedral in the distance.</p>

<p>Here it was that the ex-colonel buried himself; for
neither the entreaties of his wife nor the few relations who
came to see him, prevailed on him to change his habits.</p>

<p>But his retirement was useful to the house, for he put
the garden in order, had balconies placed at the back of
the house, furnished various rooms, had the courtyard
paved, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus, without losing its character of mystery, the dismal
old house was transformed into a pleasanter abode.</p>

<p>But the old soldier having fallen into disgrace, seemed to
wither up within its walls like a tree in want of air and
water.</p>

<p>A profound melancholy sapped his constitution: his skin
became wrinkled, his hair turned white, his legs grew feeble,
and his hands shaky.</p>

<p>At fifty-eight he looked as old as if he were seventy, but
this change was unnoticed in the house.</p>

<p>He glided about the corridors like a ghost. Whole days
went by without any one hearing the sound of his voice.
But he was not disagreeable to anybody, and there was a
sweet pleasant smile always on his lips.</p>

<p>He never courted caresses from his child, but when he
met him by chance in the passages he would lay his hand
on his head, kiss him fondly, murmur tender words in his
ear, and then turn away, sometimes with tears in his eyes.
He thought it a blot on the life of that little boy, ruddy
and beautiful as a cherubim, to have been born of a disgraced
father, and the unhappy man seemed to ask his
pardon for his existence. It was the year 1829; four years
had elapsed since the colonel arrived from America, and<a name="Page_058" id="Page_058"></a>
he looked a very spectre. He slept well, ate well, and
nothing seemed to worry him; but his life seemed slipping
away, in a slow but sure consumption. His wife sent for
a doctor, and then another and another. But they all said
the same: it was necessary for him to amuse himself and to
associate with people. And these were just the particular
remedies which the count declined to adopt. By degrees
he stayed longer in bed, he rose later, and retired to rest
earlier. He lost all inclination to work in the garden,
never went outside the four walls of the house, and indoors
he gave up looking after the things which used to interest
him, being generally handy, such as attending to the aviary
and other manual occupations. The few hours that were
not passed in bed were spent in an armchair, or in walking
through the corridors in silence, until at last he left off
getting up altogether. Luis recollected all this perfectly.
When he used to go into his father's apartments he saw
him with his eyes fixed on the ceiling and an expression
of terrible distress upon his face. He would turn his head
when his son entered the room, smile, call him to him by
signs, and after giving him a kiss would seem to want him
to go.</p>

<p>One day the boy saw much coming and going in the
house; the servants were running about in distress, exchanging
rapid words with each other. The few available
friends and relations were summoned, and frightened the
child by their long faces. On entering his father's room
he saw that an altar was being erected. Having been
placed in a corner by one of the servants, he was told not
to be afraid, but his father was about to confess, and partake
of the Holy Communion when the Divine Majesty would
be present. The injunction not to be frightened, which
was repeated several times, produced a contrary effect.
The boy understood that something serious was going on.
In fact, the Count of Onis was dying; he was certainly taking
his departure, as his relations said. The doctor said he was<a name="Page_059" id="Page_059"></a>
to be prepared.... At six o'clock in the evening the
doors of the palace of Onis were thrown open to receive
the priest, who had come in the carriage of the house
bearing the Sacred Host. The servants and relations were
waiting in the doorway with lighted torches. A large file
of people of all classes, also bearing lights, came behind.
Many of them came out of real regard and devotion for the
patient; but the majority came out of curiosity to see one
who had lived so long apart from the world under such
solemn, critical circumstances.</p>

<p>All those that wished to, came right into the presence of
the dying man. No obstacle was put in anybody's way, so a
strange and motley crowd filled the count's room: well-to-do
people, poor people, and children, were all anxious to
see the fallen man, now that he was about to fall into the
dark bosom of death, the oblivion of eternity. The dean
of the cathedral, his friend and confessor, approached with
the elevated Host. The people present fell on their knees,
a solemn silence reigned. At that moment the sick man,
who had been propped up in bed, said in a loud voice,
addressing himself to the kneeling assembly:</p>

<p>"I swear by the Sacramental God about to enter my
body, that I have never been a traitor to my country, and
that in the American war I always behaved like a loyal
and honourable gentleman."</p>

<p>His voice, which appeared to come from a corpse,
sounded clear and sharp in the room. There was a repressed
murmur among the people. The dean, with tears
in his eyes, replied:</p>

<p>"Blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness;"
and he put the blessed Sacrament in the colonel's
mouth. The news of the old soldier's affirmation ran
through the town. The strange and terrible oath, which
was repeated from one to the other, made a profound
impression on the public. The relations and friends of the
count made a great parade of the matter. One of them<a name="Page_060" id="Page_060"></a>
thought of presenting a petition to the king, signed by all
the neighbours, begging him to revoke the colonel's sentence.
But the dean had anticipated him, and being an
energetic, eloquent man, he got the archbishop and the
Chapter of the cathedral to favour his mission to Madrid
for the intercession for the re-installation of the friend of
his infancy in his military rank. Meanwhile the patient
slightly improved, the illness did not seem to get worse;
but, although it was not externally noticeable, the consumption
was gaining ground.</p>

<p>Nothing was said about the deputation to the king.
However, the dean had time to get to Madrid, gain an
audience of his Majesty, appeal to his pity with the account
of the solemn statement made in his presence, obtain a
royal commission restoring the count all his honours with
all the accompanying crosses and decorations, and return
to Lancia mad with anxiety. How delightful it was to find
his friend had not expired! He ran from the boat in which
he had travelled, to the palace of the Onis, and with the
greatest precaution, to avoid over-excitement for the patient,
the good news was communicated to him. The colonel
remained motionless for some time with his face hidden in
his hands.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"It is just two," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Let me have my uniform at once!" he exclaimed with
unusual energy, raising himself up without anybody's help.</p>

<p>"Rayo de Dios! Quick, my uniform," he repeated
more emphatically, seeing that no one moved.</p>

<p>At last the countess went to the wardrobe, and brought
it out. He had himself quickly dressed; the ribbon of
Carlos III. put across his breast, and all the crosses he
had won. There were so many, that he could not put them
all on the left side, so some had to come to the right. In
this attire he had himself led to the window looking on to
the Calle de Cerrajerías, and there he stood. It was not<a name="Page_061" id="Page_061"></a>
long before the faithful, repairing home from Mass, which
was the best attended of the Sunday services, saw this
strange, corpse-like figure, dressed in his grand uniform, at
the window. And with a feeling of sadness, respect, and
compassion, they all filed by the house with their eyes
riveted upon him.</p>

<p>For three consecutive Sundays the colonel made a point
of getting up and going through the same ceremony. He
stood for half an hour displaying his signs of honour, with
his eyes ecstatically fixed on space, without seeing or hearing
the crowd which collected before the palace with
manifestations of the gravest interest and concern. On the
fourth Sunday he wished to do the same, and peremptorily
insisted on being dressed, but he at that instant fell back
on the pillows, never to rise again. So that night God took
the brave, punctilious soldier unto Himself. Poor father!
The count could never think of that scene, so deeply graven
in his mind, without tears rising to his eyes. He had inherited
from him the exquisite delicacy of feeling, and a
susceptibility that almost amounted to weakness, without
the serenity, power of taking the initiative, and the unbending
will that had characterised Colonel Campo. The
present count had an excessively sensitive and affectionate
disposition, together with the integrity and modesty
peculiar to the Campos. But these qualities were counteracted
by a weak, fanciful, moody character, which was
doubtless inherited from his mother's family.</p>

<p>Donna Maria Gayoso, the widowed Countess of Onis,
daughter of the Baron de los Oscos, was a very original
person; so exceptionally original that she bordered on the
eccentric. In her whole family for the last three or four
generations there had been some exhibition of eccentricity
that in some members had passed into madness.</p>

<p>Her grandfather had been a hardened atheist and a
follower of Voltaire and the Encyclopædia; then he became
a victim to drunkenness in his last days, and, according to<a name="Page_062" id="Page_062"></a>
the general report, he was carried off by devils to the
infernal regions. He had really died of spontaneous combustion,
which fact gave rise to such a fabulous story. Her
father was a weak-minded man, and her mother, a woman
of uncommon energy, had him completely under her thumb.
Of his uncles, one had gone melancholy mad; another distinguished
himself in mathematics, but he was so eccentric
that his curious ways were retailed as amusing anecdotes in
Lancia; and another retired to the country, married a
peasant, and killed himself with drinking. She had only
one remaining brother, the present Baron de los Oscos. He
was an original and an eccentric creature. At the commencement
of the civil war he put himself under the banner
of the Pretender, and entered his army, but only on condition
of serving as a common soldier. This resolution
made a great sensation.</p>

<p>But all the persuasions of the grandees about Don Carlos,
and even those of the king himself, were powerless to make
him accept an officer's commission. He was wounded
several times, and in one case he was so seriously injured
in the face that he was deeply scarred; and as his face was
already as ugly as it could well be, the deep red seam
finished by rendering his appearance ghastly to a degree
that was terrible.</p>

<p>He was younger than his sister Maria, not being yet fifty,
and he lived alone and celibate in the dreary old house
belonging to the los Oscos in the Calle del Pozo, which had
certainly nothing grand about it. He rarely went to see his
sister, not from any antipathy, but from the unsociability
and crustiness of his disposition. He seldom left his house,
particularly in the daytime. He had very few friends, and
his most intimate one&mdash;in fact, the only one who might be
said to enjoy his friendship&mdash;was an uncloistered friar, who
before taking orders had served as an officer in the army.
This Fray Diego was his constant companion. The baron
inspired universal terror with his gloomy character, his<a name="Page_063" id="Page_063"></a>
eccentricities, and more especially by the fearful appearance
of his face. The children were quite panic-stricken in his
presence. Parents and nurses used him as a bugbear to
make them obedient:</p>

<p>"I will go and tell the baron about you! The baron
will come! I saw the baron to-day, and he asked me if
you were obedient," &amp;c.</p>

<p>And the baron, with his strange gestures, and rough, loud
voice, became a very ogre to the poor little innocent things.
He constantly went about armed with a pair of pistols; and
the handle of his stick was a veritable club. It was said
that he once made an end of a servant merely for having
opened a letter, and that on several occasions he seized
hold of children who dared to make faces at him in the
street, put them in the stable, undressed them, and thrashed
them soundly with the bridle of his horse. True, or invented,
these stories were calculated to make the infant
minds of Lancia regard him as a monster of ferocity from
whom they fled as fast as their trembling legs would carry
them.</p>

<p>One of the things which inspired the terror of the little
ones, and caused respect not devoid of fear in the grown-up
people, was the horse that the baron had. It was a creature
with a fiery eye, and so fierce that nobody but he and his
friend Fray Diego, who had served in the cavalry, dared to
mount him. He had to be most cleverly managed when
taken to drink, and even then the ungovernable brute
reared and kicked to the alarm of all the passers-by. When
the baron mounted and left his house, striking about him,
and laying into the horse with his whip, the neighbours
rushed to their windows, the children took refuge in the
bosoms of their mothers, and everybody gazed in terror at
the fearful centaur. Certainly the Baron de los Oscos presented
at such times a formidable aspect, with his scarred
face, bloodshot eyes, waxed, fierce-looking moustache, and
his figure looking like part of the horse.<a name="Page_064" id="Page_064"></a></p>

<p>One's imagination had to go back to the invasions of the
barbarians to find anything equal to it. Neither Alaric,
Attila, nor Odoacer could have looked more strange and
sinister, nor could they have inspired more terror than he.
Judge, then, of the effect upon the timid neighbours when
one day he took it into his head to parade the streets of the
town at midnight, accompanied by a servant, a man very
like him, on another charger.</p>

<p>The Countess of Onis was as strange in her way as her
brother. She was short and stout, with a pale, round face,
dull black eyes, hair plastered down with quince-juice gum,
and constantly dressed in the mournful garb of a nun. She
lived as secluded in her place, as a nun in a convent.
She was absolutely absorbed in devotion, but it was a
capricious, fantastic devotion, in no way similar to that
practised by really mystic souls. All her life she had shown
a tendency to eccentricity, but after the count's death it
became so marked, that her strange ways assumed the form
of rather serious manias. When she was young, her modesty
was so extreme that it became ridiculous. The ears of the
Señorita de los Oscos were so chaste that the conversation
of an English "Miss" would seem like a serjeant's in her
presence. She could not tolerate her brother's under-linen
being put with hers when the laundress took it away or
brought it home. If she was asked to sew a button on his
underclothes, she ran to her room when the task was over,
and washed her hands, when, it was said, she sprinkled
them with holy water. She compressed her figure to a
hurtful extent, and the height of the collar of her dresses
was contrary to the regulations of fashion; her under-garments
were only changed in the dark, and she never
shook hands with a man unless she had gloves on. The
history of her marriage was truly curious, full of funny
incidents which were for a long time the talk of the town,
and the account of the first night of her marriage, whether
true or false, was worthy of figuring in a novel of Paul de<a name="Page_065" id="Page_065"></a>
Kock. One need hardly say that during her marriage this
virtue of chastity became somewhat modified. But as soon
as she became a widow, she resorted to her eccentric ways
to a remarkable degree, and in her latter years they assumed
the aspect of madness. When she told her beads, which
was twice a day, she sent a servant to the poultry-yard to
separate the cock from the hens; then the forks had to be
separated from the spoons, and the hooks from the eyes.
One day the coachman came to tell her that one of the
mares had foaled, and she was so angry that, after having
sharply rebuked him for his audacity in acquainting her
with such a fact, she gave orders for having it sold. One
day she came upon a lad giving a kiss to the cook, and she
became ill with disgust, and both parties were immediately
dismissed from the house.</p>

<p>She liked to have a party at an early hour in the evening,
when she only invited clerics. On these occasions she used
to sit in an armchair where, intentionally or unintentionally,
probably intentionally, there were put two cushions so that
she seemed to be in a valley. Soon after the arrival of the
company, when the conversation became animated, she
would fall into a deep sleep, and thus remain until nine
o'clock, when the cassocked gentlemen retired, presumably,
without shaking hands. As there was a chapel in the
house she seldom went out, and when she did so, it was in
the carriage. She kept all the money that came to her
hands hidden away in secret places in the garret or the
garden. Sometimes this avarice or, as it may be more
correctly termed, this mania for hoarding, brought them
into difficulties, and she preferred to let her son borrow
money to disinterring her treasure. She was very greedy,
and fond of dainties; and she could consume a quantity
of sweets with no signs of indigestion. But such things were
not made for nuns, and so, in strange contradiction to her
pious inclinations, she hated all that savoured of the
convent.<a name="Page_066" id="Page_066"></a></p>

<p>And it was by this eccentric, one may almost say mad,
woman, that the present Count of Onis was brought up, and
his character was much affected thereby. To counteract his
excessive sensitiveness, his weak and vacillating temperament,
and his imaginative and gloomy disposition, of which
sad signs were shown at times, he ought to have been
brought up in the open air under an intelligent and energetic
master, who would have known how to inspire him with
manly strength and resolution. But, unfortunately, it was
just the contrary. The countess would not hear of any
career which would take him away from Lancia; so he
went to the local university, where he followed a course of
jurisprudence, after which rich young men think they are
entitled to pass the rest of their days in idleness. During
his college career the countess kept him under her authority
in a way that became ridiculous. He never left the house
without permission, he came in at dark, he told his beads,
and went to confession when she bade him to. Whilst his
body developed to a marvellous degree, so that he became
a fine athletic young fellow, his mind remained as submissive
and childish as that of a ten-year-old child.</p>

<p>His retired effeminate life increased the natural timidity
of his character, his sensitiveness became weakness, and his
gloomy nature secretive. And the most lamentable thing
was, that without being a shining light, he was gifted with
clear intelligence, and possessed a penetration frequently
found in reserved and timid men. He was wanting in self-confidence
and experience; but he showed a great deal of
tact in conversation; shortcomings of his neighbour never
escaped him and, as with most weak characters, he took a
mischievous delight in drawing attention to them. It is
the revenge taken by characterless people upon those who
have a vigorous and spontaneous one. Nevertheless, these
outbursts of irony and malignity were not very frequent.
He generally appeared a prudent, reserved, melancholy
young man, with courteous gentlemanly manners, a feeling<a name="Page_067" id="Page_067"></a>
heart, and full of affection and respect for his mother.
After his college career was over, his inclination and plans
were in favour of leaving Lancia, going to court, and travelling
for some time. But the countess's disapproval was enough
to make him give up the idea and remain at home. So he
spent his days in idleness without feeling in anyway obliged
ever to glance from time to time into his books of jurisprudence.
He amused himself occasionally with certain manual
occupations, and in reading the works of romance much in
vogue at the time. He became a clever carpenter, but
not so clever as his father; and then he took up watch-making.
Finally, he developed an interest in a little
property in the suburbs of the town, and set about making
great improvements there. It was called the Grange,
and it was situated a little more than a mile from
Lancia. It was a large old rambling house, with a beautiful
wood of oak trees behind, and fertile meadows in front.
The count took to going there every afternoon after dinner;
he bred black cattle, and horses as well; he planted trees,
cut canals, and raised banks. The house he hardly touched.
He gained physically by this new interest, which made him
more active and hardy, and his character improved at the
same time. The melancholy which had been so distressing
to him decreased, and he became more cheerful, his self-confidence
increased, as he had more intercourse with
people, whilst the fits of anger, rage and despair which used
to come over him without any cause, making him seem like
an epileptic to the servants, grew rarer and rarer until they
left him altogether. He thus reached his twenty-eighth
year when he began to frequent the house of the Quiñones,
and it was then that his life underwent a complete change.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock in the morning when his servant woke
him from an exciting unfinished dream to give him a letter.
With feigned indifference he dropped it on the night-table,
but scarcely had the servant left the room when he seized
it, and opened it with visible agitation.<a name="Page_068" id="Page_068"></a></p>

<p>Although his connection with Amalia was of about two
years' standing, he never opened a letter from her without
his hands trembling. They certainly did not often write to
each other; and it was probably the rarity of the occurrence
which accounted for its affecting him so much, as in truth a
deep love for her had taken root in his timid, sensitive
nature.</p>

<p>"This afternoon. By the pulpit," was all that the note
conveyed, but his mind was much agitated by the communication.
Such appointments were extremely dangerous.
In the midst of his happiness they overpowered him with a
feeling of dread he could not overcome. He had begged
Amalia to give them up, but she paid no heed to his
wishes, and he was perfectly incapable of opposing her will.
All the morning he was nervous and upset. He took a
ride to calm his nerves, and went as far as the Grange, only
to return as unsettled as when he left.</p>

<p>At the hour named he left home and went to the Calle
de Cerrajerías. It was the time of day when scarcely anybody
is about. It was three o'clock, and so people were
either at table or resting. At the end of Cerrajerías, at the
corner of Santa Lucia, is the church of San Rafael, and the
principal entrance is on that side. The count entered the
building, after taking holy water, like one about to say his
prayers. He was quite alone, or at least he seemed so at
first sight. In a few minutes his eyes became accustomed
to the semi-darkness, and he saw two or three kneeling
figures scattered about. He knelt down in the dark near
the little door of the staircase leading to the pew of the
Quiñones, and pretended to pray for a few moments. This
was very repugnant to him. He was a sincere believer,
and his strictly pious education made him have a horror of
such sacrilege. The fanaticism of his mother had left its
mark upon him, and he had a fearful dread of hell.
Amalia was also a believer, and she had a reputation for
piety in the place: she belonged to several confraternities,<a name="Page_069" id="Page_069"></a>
she was patron of several asylums, she frequently made
presents to the images, and she was generally seen with the
clergy; but this profanation she regarded with the greatest
indifference. Religion was for her a thing of respectability,
but her own pleasures and wishes seemed the
thing to be most respected. After a few minutes the
count cautiously rose, and pushed the little door, which
had been purposely left open, then he went in and
mounted the narrow winding staircase. The little pew
of the Quiñones was even darker than the Church.
He felt for the door of the passage and opened it, but
as it had glass windows looking on to the street, he
crossed it like a cat. At the door communicating with the
house, Jacoba was waiting for him. She was a woman of
more than fifty years of age, of portly form and demeanour.
She moved with difficulty, for her breath was short, from
her extreme fatness, and she always spoke in a falsetto
voice. She was discretion itself, a sealed book. The
count and Amalia had never had any other confidante.
Nobody else in the world was acquainted with their love
affair, and she had served them wonderfully through its
course. Acting as sentinel, she had often saved them from
discovery, for she had constituted herself their guardian
angel. She was not a servant in the house, but the señora
was one of her patrons. Her occupation was to run
errands to the shops for different houses, and the perquisites
made on the purchases formed the staple of her
livelihood. This was not, however, sufficient for her maintenance,
but she was alone and a spinster, and in many
houses presents were made her, and she was helped in a
hundred ways. The Señora de Quiñones was her especial
patroness, and when she became her confidante, it was like
coming upon a mine of wealth, for Amalia paid lavishly
for services which certainly deserved great compensation.</p>

<p>The go-between put her finger on her lips as a sign of
silence directly the count entered the door, but as he was<a name="Page_070" id="Page_070"></a>
already holding his breath to avoid making a noise, this
warning was quite unnecessary. Then going a little way
first, to see how the ground lay, she made him a sign to
follow her. They crossed a corridor, passed by the principal
staircase without going up it for fear of meeting some
servant, and went into the library where there was a little
staircase that led thence to the second floor. The count
proceeded on tiptoe with a beating heart. Although this
was not the first time he had been like this to the Quiñones'
house, it always seemed to him the height of temerity, and
he inwardly cursed his lover's boldness and disregard of
consequences.</p>

<p>At last they came to the señora's room. The door
opened without any one being seen, Jacoba gave the count
a gentle push, and remained herself outside.</p>

<p>Amalia withdrew her hand, which she had mechanically
held out, and with a sudden impulsive gesture, she threw
her arms round the neck of her beloved and kissed him
with tenderness. The grave man, being still upset by the
manner of his arrival, remained quiescent, and did not
reciprocate these demonstrations of affection. The lady
then gave him a maternal tap on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, coward, nobody will eat you here."</p>

<p>Luis made an effort to smile and sank into a French
chair upholstered with bright blue.</p>

<p>Amalia's room with its luxurious furniture was a contrast
to the neglect that reigned in the rest of the house. The
walls were covered with rich tapestry, the best of the collection
in the possession of the family; the bright furniture, of
Louis XV. style, was brought from Madrid, with the magnificent
ebony bedstead inlaid with marble in the alcove,
when Don Pedro was making futile efforts to win the heart
of his wife. There was a perfumed sensual atmosphere
about the place, showing the refined tastes that the foreign
lady had brought from other lands to the severe mansion of
the Quiñones. She seated herself on the count's knee,<a name="Page_071" id="Page_071"></a>
and pulling his beard, she exclaimed with a joy that could
scarcely be restrained and emanated from her whole person:</p>

<p>"See now, see how we have conquered. See how we
have got over all those difficulties which came into your
head and prevented your seeing clearly. Only a little
audacity was necessary for God to help us."</p>

<p>"God!" said the count, with a shudder.</p>

<p>She felt she had been wrong in referring to the Divinity,
and she hastened to say with unconcern:</p>

<p>"Well, then, fate, if you like. Come, don't make yourself
wretched and sad. This is a moment of happiness for
us. She is really here, and it seems too good to be true.
My daughter, the daughter of my love living with me; being
able to see her and kiss her at all hours! How beautiful
she is! I could not look at her comfortably until this
morning, but to-day I did so to my heart's content. She is
like you&mdash;particularly about the forehead between the eyebrows.
Jacoba says that the mouth is mine. I am not
sorry, for it might have taken after me in something worse,
is it not so?" she added, with a coquettish smile.</p>

<p>"I think you are beautiful all round."</p>

<p>"That is right!" exclaimed the lady with an affectionate
look. "You have at last recovered the power of speech.
Well, then," she added in a serious tone, "you do not
know the trouble we had this morning to find a nurse.
Three were brought to me, and neither of them suited. At
last I settled on the fourth. And how beautifully my angel
took to her food. I could hardly help jumping for joy, and
I can hardly help it now. But I must be grave and solemn,
like the señor count. Tell me, how did you manage to get
her here? Tell me about it. How your face looked when
the drawing-room door opened last night!"</p>

<p>"The thing was not easy. At nine o'clock I went to
fetch her from Jacoba's house. But she will have told you
about it. I had to spend two hours there, for the devil
seemed in the business, and the child screamed incessantly."<a name="Page_072" id="Page_072"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I know all that. And then?"</p>

<p>"What a night it was! The gusts of wind were incessant,
especially in those out-of-the-way suburbs. I turned up my
trousers to the knee, for how could I come into your
drawing-room covered with mud? I wanted to carry the
basket on one arm, and the open umbrella in the other
hand, but it was impossible. After a few steps, I came back
and left the umbrella with Jacoba. What a walk! Holy
heaven, what a business! The wind kept blowing down
the collar of my coat, the rain dashed in my face and down
my neck. I was frightened the baby would get wet. I went
along fearing to breathe. Supposing I had slipped just then!
The wind blew at times so strongly that I could hardly get
along. You can easily believe that I was tempted to go
back and leave it for another day."</p>

<p>"I can easily believe it. I know that a plate of water
would be enough to drown you."</p>

<p>He gave her a sad, reproachful look, and then Amalia
began to laugh, and embracing and kissing him effusively,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don't be cross, poor little dear! Do not think I do
not feel for you. The journey was very difficult. You bore
it like a hero."</p>

<p>The count coloured at these praises. His conscience
told him he did not deserve them; and he recollected the
terrible ordeal that Amalia had herself passed through, and
said:</p>

<p>"But you! What you must have suffered on your side!
How are you? It was imprudent to go downstairs so
soon."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am as strong as a horse, although I appear
weak."</p>

<p>"So you seem to be. To suffer what you did without
uttering a sound!"</p>

<p>"Pray, what can you know about it, stupid?" she said,
putting a hand on his mouth.<a name="Page_073" id="Page_073"></a></p>

<p>"Then only four days in bed," continued the young man,
gently taking her hand from his mouth and kissing it at the
same time; "and on the fifth to go down to the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"But, then, nothing was supposed to have happened, and
if I had not gone down yesterday, Quiñones would certainly
have sent for the doctor! On the second day he was worrying
for me to go down. But what do you think? He is in love
with the baby&mdash;quite mad about it! All the morning he
has had the nurse in his room. And he has such strange
ideas. He says, 'God has sent us this child to console us
for having no family.'"</p>

<p>Then the count relapsed into sadness and gloom, whilst
a smile of cruel irony played on the lips of the lady.</p>

<p>"And all this time you have never asked for her, you
unnatural father!" she said, as she passed her delicate white
fingers through her lover's thick, curly, reddish beard. "For
you <i>are</i> her father&mdash;yes, her father. That you can't deny,"
she added, fondly putting her face against his so that her
lips were close to his ear. "I will go and fetch her."</p>

<p>"But will the nurse come, too?" he asked in terror.</p>

<p>"No, man, no!" she answered, laughing; "she will come
alone. You will see that can easily be managed."</p>

<p>The count opened his eyes with an expression that made
her laugh more. She got up and, opening the door, she
whispered a second with Jacoba who was stationed as
sentinel outside. In a few minutes the stout go-between
re-opened the door and brought in the sleeping child.
Amalia sat down, and told her to put it on her lap. And
then, for a long time, they both gazed in ecstasy at the little
delicate creature as it softly breathed in its sleep. It was a
moment of happiness. The count forgot his fears and
became quite calm, whilst a smile of real pleasure illuminated
his gentle, melancholy features. The minutes
passed, and neither cared to break the blissful silence, nor
disturb the intense absorption in which their minds were<a name="Page_074" id="Page_074"></a>
one. That tiny, unconscious being, that atom of rosy flesh
riveted their gaze equally, and bound their souls and lives
to her with invisible threads.</p>

<p>"How beautiful she is! She is like you," murmured the
count so softly that the words hardly reached the ears of his
lover.</p>

<p>"She is more like you," she returned in the same subdued
voice.</p>

<p>And by a simultaneous movement, they both turned and
looked at each other with a long intense look of love.</p>

<p>"I adore you, Amalia," he said.</p>

<p>"I love you, Luis," she replied.</p>

<p>Their hands met and pressed affectionately, and their
heads were bent in the interchange of a chaste kiss.<a name="Page_075" id="Page_075"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="head">THE HISTORY OF THEIR LOVE</p>


<p class="nind">C<span class="smcap">haste</span>, yes, and perhaps it was the first kiss that had
been so in that long love affair. All that was tender and
poetic in their affection seemed to rise like a perfume, and
transport them with raptures of delight. The remorse that
had hitherto weighed so heavily on the sensitive soul of the
count was gone. The mad agitation that had tormented
them both, the ardour, violence and bitterness which, like
the hidden worm in the bud of a rose, had poisoned
their wicked love passages, had passed away. Nothing
remained but pure love&mdash;love satisfied, love consecrated
by the holy mysterious force of nature's mysteries.</p>

<p>If only they had met earlier! How often has this been
said by people in similar circumstances! And if they had
met earlier, they would probably have parted without the
slightest feeling of attraction.</p>

<p>Love flourishes on difficulties and takes root on shifting
sand, in fact they seem to be the most propitious
circumstances for its cultivation.</p>

<p>The report in Lancia was true about Amalia having been
forced into a marriage with Don Pedro by her family who
were in great straits. Don Antonio Sanchiz, the lady's
father, was a Valencian gentleman of means, but gambling
and dissipation swallowed up three-fourths of his property.
His eldest son, who had the same tastes, spent the
remaining fourth by the same means. Amalia was the
youngest of the family, which consisted of four girls and one<a name="Page_076" id="Page_076"></a>
boy. Her eldest sister, who had come in for a little of the
decaying splendour of the house, managed to marry a rich
banker. Nobody approved of the connection, especially as
neither Don Antonio nor his son Antonito managed to
see the colour of the money of their respective son, and
brother-in-law. The other two married men of good
family but without money. Amalia grew up in the midst
of the total ruin of her house. Neither her elegant figure
nor her high birth brought her admirers. The well-known
misfortunes of the house, and her father and brother's bad
reputation, constituted an unsurmountable barrier around
her. Her feelings were often touched by those who only
paid her attention out of idleness, or love of flirtation.
She was certainly not a typical beauty: she was wanting
in gracefulness of figure, plumpness of form, and brightness
of complexion. But in spite of her slight, and not at all
well formed figure, and the constant pallor of her cheeks,
there was something attractive about her, which grew upon
one the more you saw of her. Perhaps this charm lay in
her large expressive dark eyes, which reflected every
emotion: now they shone with a fire that breathed a
deep and passionate nature, now they looked quiet,
ecstatic and limpid in a sort of mystic rapture, now they
were merry and mischievous, now they were dreamy and
melancholy, now tender and tearful, now sparkling with
fun or shining with anger. Perhaps her charm lay in
her versatility, in the keenness of her intellect, in her
sympathetic and insinuating voice. She was, in short,
an interesting, charming woman. I do not know whether
it was owing to her pride or her naturally tempestuous
mind, but scorning the young men of her own rank, who
courted her without resolving to ask for her hand, she
lost her heart to a modest young man, a poor government
clerk with an income of forty thousand reales,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
son of a schoolmaster. The blue blood of the Sanchiz in<a name="Page_077" id="Page_077"></a>
the veins of Antonio, Antonito, her sisters, and the banker,
her brother-in-law, in whom it was conspicuous by its
absence, boiled in indignation.</p>

<p>She was the victim of active, fierce persecution. But as
she was not wanting in spirit, and was moreover possessed
of a mind fertile in resources, she certainly managed to defy
the family for some time; their entreaties and threats were
of no avail and her time of enforced retreat in a convent
was equally ineffectual. If the clerk had not happened to
die of phthisis, which killed him in a few months, it is almost
certain that the very noble and straitened house of the
Sanchiz would have had to see itself allied to the son of a
schoolmaster.</p>

<p>After this adventure Amalia lost caste in the place. But
she well knew that if she had retained her prestige, it would
have been the same. Men do not marry for prestige, but
for money. It never occurred to her to feel remorse for
the past. She lived sad and resigned for two years,
showing an utter indifference to the pleasures belonging
to her position, and without making any effort to gain the
good graces of the young men so as to get a husband.
It was when she was about twenty-four years old and she
had given up all thought of matrimony, that Don Pedro
Quiñones, her third or fourth cousin, began to think about
her. She rebelled against marrying this gentleman, whom
she had only seen two or three times as a child, and who
had been a widower for a short time, and whose eccentricities
she had heard her father and brother relate with fits of
laughter, and now they were the very ones to press her
acceptance of him as a husband! She was not very firm in
her resistance. She was so disillusioned, she lived in such a
state of deep dejection and apathy, that as soon as her father
became angry about the matter and pressed her to accede
to his entreaties he extorted a consent. They all said
that the marriage would be the salvation of the family.
She did not trouble to find out if that were the truth or<a name="Page_078" id="Page_078"></a>
not. After she was married, she found that all that they
could get out of Don Pedro was a little allowance, which
gave them hardly enough for food.</p>

<p>So the noble descendant of the Quiñones of Leon was
hopelessly in love with a statue. On the journey that they
made from Valencia to Lancia the bride was so cold and
circumspect, but at the same time polite, that Don Pedro
was kept at the same distance as at the beginning of his
suit. In Lancia we know what the public version of the
story was. The persistent coldness and the infinite contempt
with which she treated him for some time, far from
repelling him, only increased his passion. Quiñones was,
as we know, of a strong, tenacious, indomitable will. The
obstacles which at first merely irritated him, finally enraged
him. He wanted to conquer the heart of his wife, and he
spared no means in the attempt: he overwhelmed her with
attentions, he gratified her slightest wishes, and lived
for several months in perpetual anxiety, in a perfect fever
of alternate hope and despair. He would, however,
never have attained his end without the astuteness of
his friend the canon, who advised him to take a journey in
the mountains, which, rife with frights and dangers, drew
them together in closer intimacy. During the first two
years of her marriage Amalia led a retired life, without
ever hardly leaving the gloomy old palace of the Calle
de Santa Lucia. She lived alone in her depression, and
made her life more sad than it need have been, by nursing
a dumb rebellion against a fate that threatened to drive
her insane. To all outward appearance she was resigned,
treating those that were about her with studied courtesy.
The dreadful illness which happened to her husband
distracted her a little, and a sentiment of pity touched
her heart. For some time she thought she was destined
for the vocation of a nursing sister, and she tried
with assumed affection to make his life more bearable
to him. By degrees she grew to like the little gatherings<a name="Page_079" id="Page_079"></a>
of friends round her husband, and she began to interest herself
and take part in the local political conversations.</p>

<p>Don Pedro was the arbiter of the province whilst the
Moderate party was in power. Now that it was out, he still
retained great prestige and influence, from people not
knowing how long it would be before it was in again.
It was to augment this prestige and this influence, and to
add to the dignity of the house, that Amalia opened her
drawing-rooms to the Lancian society that she had hitherto
kept at a distance, doing nothing but pay a few
complimentary visits. She now gave concerts, organised
sociable gatherings, and had large state balls, by means of
which she regained her lost energy, and the gracious
and sympathetic versatility which had characterised her;
the light returned to her eyes and the smile to her lips.
Nobody could better do the honours of her entertainments.
She was a model of gentleness and courtesy, and she
made herself adored by the young people of the place to
whom she afforded the means of killing interminable winter
evenings.</p>

<p>Fernanda Estrada-Rosa was one of the most beautiful
ornaments of her concerts and parties. The Count of Onis,
her admirer, came in her train. The count had long been
on visiting terms at the house of Quiñones, but until lately
he only went occasionally in the evening for a formal visit,
or at the new year, &amp;c. Notwithstanding, he had a profound
sympathy for Quiñones. It was enough for him to belong
to the nobility, for the young noble to consider him superior
in all respects to everybody else in the place. Amalia, who
hardly knew him, began to observe him with much curiosity.
She had heard so much said about his affection and respect
for his mother, his melancholy temperament, his habits and
his exaggerated piety, that she wished to cultivate his
acquaintance, she wanted to gauge the depths of the soul
of such a superior and high-minded young man. She was
not long in seeing that he was not yet in love. Noting his<a name="Page_080" id="Page_080"></a>
attention to Fernanda with interest, she perceived a coldness
on his side which was certainly not on that of the rich
heiress. She knew that the count was deceiving himself,
making efforts to fall in love, or at any rate, to seem so.
He seemed to look upon love as an obligation pertaining to
his age and position. The chief young man in Lancia
ought to love the richest, most beautiful girl of Lancia.
Besides, it seemed as if he also wanted to show the place
that he was neither eccentric nor a maniac, as he had heard
that he was reported to be. He therefore went in for being
a recognised lover; he spent a couple of hours in the morning
in the Calle de Altavilla, where his young lady lived, he sat
at her side at the parties of the Señoritas de Meré or de
Quiñones, and he danced with her at the balls of the
Casino. But at the same time Amalia did not fail to see,
with considerable interest, that his conversation was cold,
and that the count was often silent and distrait until she
took part in the conversation and made it more lively.</p>

<p>The love affair interested her more and more, she courted
the girl's confidence as well as his. It was not long before
her ardent, sagacious, strong-willed soul sympathised with
that of Luis, which was so timid, childlike, pitiful, and affectionate.
More proficient in the art of love-making than the
Estrada-Rosa girl, she soon won the count's confidence
and affection and she drew from him a number of confidences,
not only about his feelings, but the whole of his
life. No clever Jesuit could have made a better confessor.
Luis, delighted at such a show of interest, completely
opened his heart to her, at first telling her his habits, then
relating things of his past life, and finally confiding secret
feelings which are only told to a brother. But Amalia
expressed no surprise at such original and morbid thoughts;
she gave her opinion on them, and told him affectionately
that he might confide in her and count upon her counsel in
difficult matters of life, of which complicated mechanism
the count was totally ignorant. This clever game advanced<a name="Page_081" id="Page_081"></a>
her scheme, and he confided in her more and more, happy in
the opportunity of unbosoming sentimental ideas, and confessing
the strange unhappy timidity to which he was a victim.</p>

<p>Amalia knew how to avoid arousing Fernanda's jealousy
by posing as the confidante and protectress of her love. If
she had long and interesting conversations with the count,
she had equally long and interesting ones with her. She
would have great pleasure in giving them assistance in the
form of finding them opportunities of seeing and talking to
each other, and when they understood each other, &amp;c. &amp;c.
But, without the innocent girl suspecting it, without even
the count realising it, the Valencian lady rapidly gained the
affections of Luis. If in youth, beauty, and elegance, she
was inferior to the rich heiress, she was much superior in
expressive grace of countenance, power of conversation, and
fine intelligence. The count soon came to telling her what
was the true state of his heart with regard to Fernanda. The
astute Señora knew how to turn such confidences to her own
advantage by making him see that what he felt was only
admiration for the beautiful works of nature, a vain desire to
make himself beloved by the prettiest and richest girl in the
town, the necessity of distraction from depression&mdash;anything,
in short, but real love. That was shown in great sadness,
ineffable joy, sleepless nights, anxiety, and agitation, both
sweet and bitter, by which the breast is constantly consumed.</p>

<p>Luis was soon won over to her opinion. Then she
added that his coldness was unjustifiable; she did not
understand how a man of such good taste had not fallen
hopelessly in love ere this. She joked him, she laughed
at him, and she praised the qualities of the gentle heiress
up to the clouds.</p>

<p>But whilst she said this with her lips, her eyes belied
her words: the black pupils, so full of fire and intelligence,
were fixed on him with an expression somewhat languid,
somewhat malicious, which ended by fascinating him. At
the same time her small, delicate, aristocratic hands took<a name="Page_082" id="Page_082"></a>
hold of his on every occasion; and on parting she pressed
them with nervous tenacity. If sometimes, in bending to
look at anything, their heads touched, Amalia did not move
hers, and the count was not loth to inhale the subtle
perfume which entered his veins like poison. She took a
great interest in his clothes, and told him what she liked:
he was not to wear a frock-coat, the blue jacket suited him
admirably. Why did he like dark gloves?</p>

<p>"I forbid you," she said, laughing, "to wear them any
more."</p>

<p>She professed a great taste for cravats, and she told him
that those in a bow suited him better than those in a
knot.</p>

<p>"Why do you not get your hats from Madrid?" she
asked. "Those that you get in Lancia are so old-fashioned
and ridiculous."</p>

<p>And the count was pleased to follow her suggestions,
and gradually let himself be ruled by the woman who was
so weak in body and so strong in will.</p>

<p>One night on arriving at the Quiñones' house before anybody
else, the lady said to him sharply:</p>

<p>"Who gave you that button-hole? Fernanda?"</p>

<p>The count smiled and coloured, as he gave a sign in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>"Then you must excuse my saying it is a very ugly
colour. Look here, I will give you a prettier one."</p>

<p>So saying, she went straight to a flower-stand in the
room, and took out a magnificent pink clove. She then
turned to where the count was standing, and with great
boldness, although with a certain affectation of one who is
showing her power, she took away the flower he was wearing,
and replaced it by the fresh one. He suffered this
substitution in silence, upset and surprised. She, feigning
not to notice his surprise, took a step back, and said with
interest:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that is better!"<a name="Page_083" id="Page_083"></a></p>

<p>Then ensued a few minutes of embarrassed silence. She
then began to play with Fernanda's clove, pulling the
petals, whilst darting frequent glances at the count, who
stood confused, not knowing what to say, nor where to
look. At last their eyes met with a smile. There was a spark
of malice in hers, and in the sudden scornful gesture with
which she threw the flower she held in her hand under a chair.</p>

<p>The count instantly became serious, and his cheeks
coloured. At that moment Manuel Antonio came in.</p>

<p>The count could not regain his equanimity.</p>

<p>When Fernanda arrived, and, with visible displeasure,
asked him for her clove, he was in a very awkward position.
The gardener's little boy was said to have pulled it from him
when he stooped to kiss him, and so he had taken another
from his mother's room. But Amalia, who was implacable,
made matters worse by saying in a loud voice with a
malicious smile:</p>

<p>"Who gave you that beautiful clove? Fernanda?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he hastily replied.</p>

<p>And then the count, quite red and upset, had to proceed
to give in a loud voice the explanation he had been giving
in an undertone to Fernanda. That little act of treason
was a bond between them; it established a peculiar relation
which the count did not dare to define in his thoughts, for
he trembled as though an abyss yawned at his feet. He
continued paying attention to the heiress of Estrada-Rosa
with the same, if not more, assiduity, but he could never
talk with the Señora of Quiñones without feeling agitated;
her glances were long and earnest, the pressure of her hand
was full of affection, and yet they both acted before
Fernanda as if she were already his affianced wife. And
yet they had not uttered a word of love! But Luis knew
he was not treating the lady he was courting fairly, and that
he was acting criminally with regard to Don Pedro, his
friend. He did not know how, or why, but his conscience
told him that he was. Sometimes he tried to persuade<a name="Page_084" id="Page_084"></a>
himself that he had not taken one step in the direction of
crime, that he was involved in a train of circumstances in
which love, intelligence, treason, all played a part without
one's knowing how it had happened.</p>

<p>More than a month passed by in this way. Amalia not
only discoursed to him of love with her eyes, but she made
him carry out all her most capricious fancies whilst sometimes
sharply calling him to task.</p>

<p>If, for example, he caught a glance from Amalia when he
was going for a walk telling him to stay, he would stay. If
he was about to dance with Fernanda, a severe look would
prevent him doing so.</p>

<p>One day he announced his intention of going for six or
eight days to his property in Onis; but Amalia made a
negative sign with her head, and he gave up the idea.
What right had she thus to cross his wishes and direct his
line of conduct? He did not know, but he felt very
pleased to obey her. He lived in a state of pleasant,
exciting unrest, sometimes hoping for something so
ineffably delightful, that he hardly dared to formulate it
even to himself.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile she quietly watched him with her
sphinx-like smile, strong in the conviction that the something
would happen when the time was ripe.</p>

<p>One afternoon in June the count was at The Grange inspecting
the operations of some workmen he was employing
in opening a wider aqueduct for the mill, when the boy who
minded the cattle, came to tell him that a lady wanted him.</p>

<p>"A lady?" he exclaimed, surprised; "do you not know
her?"</p>

<p>The servant stared stupidly without replying. How
could he know her, when he had passed his life among the
cattle and only went to Lancia on some market-day to buy
or sell a cow? The count recollected this, and proceeded
to inquire:</p>

<p>"Is she short?"<a name="Page_085" id="Page_085"></a></p>

<p>"No, she is very tall, Señor."</p>

<p>"Eyes very black and bright, pale colour? her gait
graceful and elegant?"</p>

<p>And before the servant could answer these questions that
he had not understood, he began running in the direction of
the house with his heart beating with excitement at the presentiment
that it was her.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he cried, without ceasing running.</p>

<p>"In the courtyard by the garden door," shouted the boy
in reply.</p>

<p>He arrived breathless at the courtyard, but before opening
the door he stopped for an instant to check his presumption.
How could he have thought of such a thing?
What devil could have put it into his head?... Notwithstanding
he could not dismiss the idea. It was she, it was
she&mdash;he could not doubt the fact.</p>

<p>He raised the bolt of the large wooden door, painted
green, and went in. The courtyard was large. Several
outhouses for working purposes were built against the wall.
Tied up to a roughly made wooden kennel was an enormous
mastiff, who pulled at his chain as if he would break it in
his attempts to get near his master.</p>

<p>There at the other end, near the iron gate communicating
with the garden, he actually saw her looking through the
bars at the flowers. She had her back to him. She was
dressed in a light pink and white striped dress, with a little
straw hat trimmed with roses. In her left hand she had a
sunshade which matched her dress, and in her right she
held some silk gloves.</p>

<p>How these details became engraven in his memory!
They were indelibly fixed in his mind!</p>

<p>"You here?" he said, feigning a calmness he was very
far from feeling. "Who would have thought that you were
the señora whose arrival the servant just announced to me?"</p>

<p>"Did you really not think it was me?" she asked, looking
at him fixedly.<a name="Page_086" id="Page_086"></a></p>

<p>"No, no, Señora."</p>

<p>But he coloured even as he said it, and the lady smiled
kindly.</p>

<p>"Very well; now show me the Malmaison roses you told
me about."</p>

<p>The count opened the gate, and they both went through
to the garden, which was very large and somewhat neglected.</p>

<p>Since the countess had almost entirely given up coming
to the Grange, the servants hardly touched it. Luis was more
interested in making experiments with new modes of agriculture,
breeding cattle, and draining ground, than in
gardening. But there were many kinds of flowers, put
there when his mother used to tend them every afternoon,
and there were great bushes which time, combined with the
fertile soil, had transformed into thick trees.</p>

<p>Whilst they passed along the walks, which were over-grown
with moss, the countess explained in high, clear
tones how she came to be there.</p>

<p>She had wished to drive to Bellavista, but passing by the
little road that led to the Grange, she recollected the beautiful
roses, and gave orders to the coachman to go that way.
She had never seen the place before, she said; and she
became quite enthusiastic over the thick foliage and the
intense green of the place. In her country the vegetation
was much paler.</p>

<p>"But more fragrant&mdash;like the women," said the count
with gallantry.</p>

<p>The lady turned to give him a smile of thanks, and went
on praising the beauty of the rhododendrons, the azaleas,
and the gigantic camellias.</p>

<p>As soon as they had seen the roses, and the count
had made her choose some to have sent to her the
next day, they directed their steps towards the entrance-gate.</p>

<p>"And are you sure that I only came to see the roses?"<a name="Page_087" id="Page_087"></a>
said Amalia, suddenly stopping and fixing her eyes upon
him.</p>

<p>The count's heart gave a bound, and he commenced to
stammer in a lamentable fashion.</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;this visit, certainly. I should be so
pleased if the rose-trees&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the lady, taking pity on him, did not let him proceed.</p>

<p>"Well, besides the rose-trees, I came to see the whole
place, particularly the wood. And so you can show it to
me," she added resolutely, taking him by the arm.</p>

<p>Whereupon the count was conscious of a new and violent
emotion, at first painful, and then pleasurable, as he felt
the lady's hand upon his arm. And moved to his inmost
being at the honour conferred on him, he showed everything
of interest on the estate: the beautiful large meadows, the
stables, the new machinery for working the mill, and finally
the wood.</p>

<p>She watched him out of the corner of her eye. Sometimes
a smile of amusement played about her lips. She entered
into everything with interest, praised the improvements he
had made, and suggested fresh ones. And, in going about,
she sometimes let the count's arm drop, and then took it
again, which inspired the count with many diverse sensations,
all intense and exciting. When she noticed he was
getting more at his ease, she made some little sudden
mischievous remark which plunged him into fresh confusion
and made him blush to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>"Now, count, when you caught sight of me just now, you
said to yourself: 'Amalia has fallen in love with me and
she cannot resist the desire to come and see me.'"</p>

<p>"Amalia, <i>por Dios</i>! What can make you say that?
How could I ever have dared&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But the lady, without seeming to notice his distress or to
lay any importance on her own words, passed immediately
to another subject. She seemed to like shocking him,
and keeping him agitated and trembling. And in the<a name="Page_088" id="Page_088"></a>
furtive glances she cast at him there was the touch of
superiority and irony of one, who was sure of the game.</p>

<p>The count turned grave under that enigmatical smile.
He saw he was playing an awkward part, and, feeling that
she was laughing at him, he made heroic efforts to recover
his equanimity.</p>

<p>The lady admired, and was more enthusiastic about the
wood than anything. It was a mass of ancient oaks, where
the sun never penetrated. The ground was carpeted with
thick turf and quite free from caltrops. No other private
property was so richly wooded; it was, perhaps, due to
the primitive forest where the monastery had been founded
which was the origin of Lancia.</p>

<p>The lady found it pleasant to rest a little under the green
bower where the light hardly penetrated. A peace, a
pleasant calmness sweeter than the silence and calm of a
Gothic cathedral, pervaded the place. She leant her back
against a tree and gave a long look at the thick foliage
around her.</p>

<p>The count stood near. Both were silent for some time.
At last the man felt, without seeing it, that the lady's gaze
was fixed upon him. He resisted the magnetic attraction
of the look for some minutes. When at last he raised his
eyes, he saw that her expression was so merry and daring
that he dropped them again. Amalia gave vent to a mischievous
laugh, which surprised, confused, and somewhat
irritated him; and then seeing that her merriment did not
cease, he said with a forced smile:</p>

<p>"At what are you laughing, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," she returned, putting her handkerchief
to her mouth. "Take me to see the house."</p>

<p>And then she took his arm again. The house was a
large, very old building of yellowish stone, worm-eaten by
age, with two little square towers at the sides. Everything
about it was shabby or worn out. Some bars were wanting
in the stair-rails as well as in the balconies; the ceilings of<a name="Page_089" id="Page_089"></a>
the rooms were discoloured, the partition walls cracked,
the plaster in holes; the looking-glasses, so much thought
of in bygone days, were so covered with dust that they
reflected nothing; the walls were damp and dirty, and the
pictures hung thereon were so discoloured that one could
not see what the artists had intended to depict; the scanty
furniture of the rooms was worn out by the use of past
generations. The things were all quite done for. Amalia
liked the look of past grandeur. How many different
beings had lived in that house! How they must have
laughed and wept in these large rooms. Each one had its
particular name: one was called the cardinal's room,
because in times past a cardinal of the family occupied it
when on a visit to the Grange; another the portrait-room,
because a few pictures hung on the walls; and another the
new room, although it looked as old and even older than
the rest of the apartments. Everything bore traces of the
private life of a family of bygone ages.</p>

<p>"This is the countess's chamber," said Luis, as he took
his friend into a moderate-sized room, which, in spite of the
dust and ravages of time, looked better furnished than the
others. It was an elegant style of apartment, bearing evidence
that past generations had not been destitute of a love
of decoration. There was a Pompadour escritoire, some
chairs of the Regency, several pictures in pastel; and
painted on the ceiling were cherubs floating in an atmosphere
which had once been blue.</p>

<p>"Is this your mother's room?" asked Amalia.</p>

<p>"No," replied the count, smiling; "my mother sleeps on
the other side. It has been called the countess's from time
immemorial. Perhaps some old ancestor of mine chose it
for herself. I often take my siesta here when the fatigue
of going about the estate makes me want to have a sleep."</p>

<p>In one of the corners of the apartment there was a
splendid bedstead of carved oak, grown black with age, one
of those beds of the fifteenth century that antiquaries go<a name="Page_090" id="Page_090"></a>
perfectly mad on. The hangings were also very ancient,
but there was a modern damask counterpane spread over
the mattress.</p>

<p>"So it is here that you retire to think of me to your
heart's content, is it not?" said Amalia.</p>

<p>The count looked as stunned as if she had given him a
blow on the head.</p>

<p>"I! Amalia! How?"</p>

<p>Then with a sudden assumption of courage he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Amalia, you are quite right! I think of you
here as, for some time past, I think of you everywhere I go.
I do not know what has come to me: I live in a constant
state of excitement, which, as you told me, is a sign of true
love. I am in fact madly in love with you. I know that it
is an atrocity, a crime, but I cannot help myself. Forgive
me."</p>

<p>And, like one of his noble ancestors of the Middle Ages,
the gentleman fell on his knees at the feet of the lady.</p>

<p>She was terribly angry at first. What? Was he not
ashamed of such a confession? Did he not understand
that it was an insult to address such words to her in his
house? How could he suppose that she could quietly
listen to such words? It seemed impossible that the
Conde of Onis, such a perfect gentleman, could be so
wanting in the respect due to a lady and to himself.</p>

<p>The count remained prostrate on his knees under such a
storm of invectives. He knew his words had been of grave
import, but the anger that they provoked in the lady was
not what he had most feared.</p>

<p>At last Amalia was silent. She regarded him for some
seconds with eyes blazing with fury, but a happy smile soon
suffused her expressive face. She approached him with a
slow, majestic step, put her hand upon his shoulder, and
bending down to bring her lips to his ear, she said in a loud
voice:<a name="Page_091" id="Page_091"></a></p>

<p>"You are quite right not to be ashamed of anything of
this, for I love you at least as much as you love me."</p>

<p>Then the young man seemed to go mad with joy. The
terror was over, and he clasped and kissed her knees in a
frenzy of delight, breaking into a torrent of incoherent,
passionate words, full of fire and truth; whilst she, so short
and diminutive, gazed at the adoring Colossus with her
mysterious Valencian eyes glowing with passion and love.</p>

<p>It was thus that the Conde of Onis accomplished the
difficult task of winning the affections of the elegant Señora
of Don Pedro Quiñones de Leon.</p>

<p>The first months of their connection, fraught with
poignant remorse and fascinating delight, were very
agitating to the count. Amalia went occasionally to the
Grange. At the social gathering in the evening she would
give an account of her visit in a high-pitched voice; and he
was in an agony of confusion, anxiety, and distress, whilst
she with perfect <i>sang froid</i> told all that she could tell;
spoke of the garden, scolded him for its state of neglect;
and she amused herself with bringing home some plants
every time she went there, so as to clear the ground,
as he did not care for them; in short, her audacity became
almost farcical.</p>

<p>"Would you believe it?" she said one day; "there is no
bearing with this gentleman since ladies have taken to
visiting him. You cannot think what airs he gives himself.
I am afraid that the next time I go to the Grange he will
make me wait in the hall."</p>

<p>The guests laughed, and said really some notice ought to
be taken about it; and as Fernanda smiled she cast an
affectionate glance at the count; Don Pedro even relaxed
his severe expression and burst into a roar of laughter. At
such moments it was indeed a superhuman effort for the
count to keep his countenance, when an abyss seemed to
open at his feet. When alone with Amalia he reproached
her for her audacity, and implored her by all that she held<a name="Page_092" id="Page_092"></a>
sacred to be more cautious; whilst she, perfectly unmoved,
seemed to take a pleasure in his anxiety, and her lips curled
in a disdainful enigmatical smile.</p>

<p>As they could not often meet at the Grange, Amalia
managed other interviews, by admitting Jacoba into her
confidence. In this person's house they met two or three
times a week. The count entered by a little door opening
on to a certain little street at one o'clock in the day, when
people were dining. He had to wait at least two or three
hours, and Amalia at last managed to get there under the
pretext of having some commission for her <i>protégée</i>. But
not being satisfied with this arrangement, she conceived the
idea of his entering her house by the pew of the church of
San Rafael. The count was horrified at such a man&oelig;uvre;
all his religious scruples revolted at the idea; he was
terrified at the possibility of the discovery of the intrigue
and the profanation of the sanctuary. What a scandal it
would be! But Amalia laughed at his fears as if the terrible
consequences of retribution did not concern her. She was
a woman who had absolute confidence in her star. As
first-rate toreadors consider themselves quite safe under
the very horns of the bull, as long as they keep their presence
of mind, so she set danger at defiance, and even
went out of her way to court it with a coolness that was
foolhardy.</p>

<p>And it must be confessed that her supreme calmness and
incredible audacity saved her more than once. The
Conde de Onis, the colossal man with a long beard, was a
mere puppet in the hands of the bold, unprincipled little
woman.</p>

<p>A mad passion had taken possession of them both,
especially of her. By degrees she became so accustomed to
not living without him, that a day was not bearable without
seeing him alone, and to this end she brought incredible
efforts of ingenuity and skill into play. If the combination
of circumstances was such as to render it impossible for<a name="Page_093" id="Page_093"></a>
three or four days to have a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, her temper
revolted against the restraint like an impatient prisoner,
and she was ready to commit the greatest imprudence:
she squeezed his hand and gave him little pinches in the
presence of guests; she embraced him behind the doors,
when under some pretext or another she escorted him into
another room; and more than once she kissed him on the
lips in the very presence of the Grandee, when he happened
to turn his head, whilst Luis trembled and turned pale as a
catastrophe seemed imminent.</p>

<p>By the expiration of some months his engagement with
Fernanda gradually cooled, and it ended by being broken
off altogether. This was all a preconcerted plan of Amalia's,
arranged from the beginning with consummate art: she
began by telling him how long he might be with his <i>fiancée</i>,
notified the number of times he could ask her to dance, and
finally it was she who suggested what he was to say to her.
And as she had foreseen, the heiress of Estrada-Rosa,
being proud, could not brook her lover's coldness, and so
gave him back his liberty and his word.</p>

<p>The poor girl confided her trouble to Amalia, who was
the only person who knew the cause of the much-talked-of
broken engagement. She expressed great indignation at
the count's behaviour, and spoke in strong terms of disapprobation
of his conduct. In fact, she took the young
girl's part and launched into praises on her behalf and
spoke most flatteringly of her eyes, figure, discretion, and
amiability; and she even went so far as to take ostensible
measures for their reconciliation. In the bosom of confidence,
particularly among the friends of Don Juan Estrada-Rosa,
she was not contented with saying that Fernanda was
superior to her ex-lover in every feeling, but she proclaimed
Luis as an arrant impostor, hypocrite, &amp;c. And when she
saw him the next day in Jacoba's house, she embraced him,
choking with laughter, saying:</p>

<p>"What a character I gave you yesterday before the<a name="Page_094" id="Page_094"></a>
various friends of Don Juan! You don't know! pincers
would not get the words out of my mouth again!"</p>

<p>What with all this, and the remorse continually preying
on him, the count was in a perpetual state of agitation.
How far he was from being happy! But it was a way strewn
with flowers, compared to what was coming. Five months
after entering into this <i>liaison</i>, Amalia informed him that
she believed she was <i>enceinte</i>. She told him this with a
smile on her lips, as if she were mentioning that she had
drawn a good ticket in the lottery. Luis felt giddy with
terror, turned pale, and looked as if he were about to fall.</p>

<p>"<i>Dios mio</i>! what a misfortune!" he exclaimed, covering
his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"Misfortune?" she returned in surprise. "Why? I am
very happy."</p>

<p>Then seeing his eyes dilate in stupefaction, she laughingly
explained that she was glad to have a pledge of
their love, and that she had no fear because she would
have everything so arranged that nothing would be discovered.
And in truth she laced herself so tightly that
nobody would have thought another creature's life was
bound up in hers. The anxiety and distress of the count
during this time of expectancy was awful! If any one looked
at her attentively he trembled, and if, in the course of
conversation, any guest made a casual allusion to some act
of dissimulation, he turned pale as he thought they were
speaking of him. He imagined smiles and meaning glances
in every face, and the most innocent remarks were fraught
in his mind with the deepest and most compromising
insinuations.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Amalia ate and slept with composure,
and her constant cheerfulness astonished the count, whilst
it excited his admiration. Time went by, the seven months
passed, and then the eighth. And hide as he would the
fact from himself, there was no denying that the figure of
his beloved was no longer slight; but when he made the<a name="Page_095" id="Page_095"></a>
remark to her in a great state of anxiety, she burst out
laughing:</p>

<p>"Be silent, you foolish creature! You notice it because
you know about it. Who is going to suspect anything
because I am a little stouter? Sometimes one likes a loose
corsage."</p>

<p>When the critical time arrived, she evinced a courage
bordering on heroism. Luis wanted her to have a doctor.</p>

<p>"But why?" she said; "Jacoba's services will be quite
sufficient, and it would be dangerous to trust the secret to
anybody else."</p>

<p>The first symptoms came on in the early morning, so she
kept her bed; but it was not until eight o'clock that she
sent for Jacoba, who had been sleeping for some days in the
house on pretence of making curtains. Then they were
both locked in the room where everything in the way of
linen was prepared; and without a groan, without an unnecessary
movement, this brave woman went through the
ordeal. The little creature was subsequently taken away
by Jacoba in a bundle of linen after the servants had been
sent out on various pretexts.</p>

<p>The count wept with joy and admiration at the happy
solution of the difficulty. But when Jacoba told him that
he was to take the child to the Quiñones' door, he was quite
overwhelmed. However, although his lover's plan quite
took him aback, he did what he was told, and the crowning
audacity of the lady turned out as she had foreseen. So
now that the child was safe for ever, their love not only
seemed strengthened and purified, but they felt the delightful
flush of victory over unheard-of dangers before finally
arriving in the port of safety.</p>

<p>With their heads bent over the child, and sometimes
touching its forehead with their lips, they sat with their
hands clasped in one another's, and talked, or rather wove
dreams in their efforts to gain a glimpse into the unfathomable
abysses of the future.<a name="Page_096" id="Page_096"></a></p>

<p>"What was to be the fate of the lovely little creature? How
was she to be educated?" Amalia said she would undertake
to have it treated like her own daughter, she would
have her brought up as a perfect little lady, and she was
sure Don Pedro would not oppose her in the matter. And
as he would have no sons, what was more likely than that
he would take a fancy to it and leave her a lot of money at
his death.</p>

<p>But the count repudiated this idea with scorn. The
child should have nothing from Don Pedro. He would
leave her all his own money.</p>

<p>"But perhaps you will marry and have children,"
returned the lady, glancing at him with a mischievous
smile. Then his fingers were laid on her lips in protest.</p>

<p>"Silence! silence! You know I can't bear anything of
that; I am for ever united to thee."</p>

<p>Whereupon she kissed him with effusion.</p>

<p>"That's a compact, is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It is a compact," he replied, in a tone of decision.</p>

<p>"But do not trouble about leaving her your property in
a will, because it would give rise to the suspicion that she
is your daughter."</p>

<p>This difficulty absorbed them both for some minutes.
Both were busy devising some means of eluding it. The
count wanted to leave it to some confidential person in
trust; but this idea also bristled with drawbacks, and they
thought it would be better for the money to accumulate
in his name in some bank until she came of age, and
then a father could be invented who had fallen from the
skies.</p>

<p>At last Amalia concluded by saying: "We shall talk
for ever of this. Leave it to me."</p>

<p>And he was only too pleased to leave it to her, as he
had unbounded confidence in her inexhaustible imagination,
power of will, and limitless audacity.</p>

<p>When tired of talking of the future, they turned their<a name="Page_097" id="Page_097"></a>
attention to the present. The child had to be baptised,
and the ceremony was fixed for the following day.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we have settled that I am to be the godmother,
and you the godfather."</p>

<p>"What! I?" he exclaimed in astonishment. "But, my
dear woman, do you not understand that it will give rise to
suspicions?"</p>

<p>But the lady was obstinate. She had set her heart on
his being godfather. If it gave rise to suspicions, well and
good. She would do it without the least fear.</p>

<p>Then, seeing that he was really distressed at the idea,
she changed her mind.</p>

<p>"Do not vex yourself, man, do not vex yourself," she
said, giving a little pull at his beard. "It was only a joke.
It would be fun to see you hold it at the font. I believe
you would call out: 'Señores, here! come every one of you
and see the father of this child.'"</p>

<p>It was finally settled that the godfather was to be
Quiñones, with Don Enrique Valero as his proxy, and she
was to be the godmother, with Maria Josefa as her
representative; and the count was quite satisfied with the
arrangement. All that was cleverly and prudently arranged
in a way to secure the welfare of his child. But just when
he was feeling more comfortable, a noise in the passage
made him jump from his armchair, and turn perfectly livid.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, man?"</p>

<p>"That noise?"</p>

<p>"It is Jacoba."</p>

<p>But seeing he was still uneasy, and his eyes looked
scared, she got up, and holding the child in her arms she
opened the door and exchanged a few words with Jacoba,
who was in fact still there. After giving her the baby
and locking the door, she came back and sat down
again.</p>

<p>"How could you be such a coward, eh?"</p>

<p>"It is not cowardice," he returned, blushing. "It is<a name="Page_098" id="Page_098"></a>
being so constantly upset. I don't know what has come
to me. Perhaps it is conscience."</p>

<p>"Bah! it is because you are a coward. What is the
good of having such a powerful body if you have no spirit
in it?"</p>

<p>Then, noticing the expression of pain and distress that
overshadowed his face, she turned and embraced him with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"No, you are not a coward, but you are innocent, eh?
And it is that that I love you for. I love you more than
my life, and you love your little girl, don't you? I am all
yours. You are my only love. I am not really married."</p>

<p>Then she caressed him in a kitten-like way, passing her
delicate white hands over his face, and kissing him several
times; then she put her arms round his neck, and gave him
little mouse-like bites. And at the same time, she, who
was generally so grave and quiet, let flow a perfect stream
of affectionate words which calmed and charmed him to a
wonderful degree. The fire which shone in her mysterious,
large, treacherous-looking eyes, now broke forth in veritable
flames. Passion had taken possession of her being, but it
was also fraught with the malicious pleasure of a satisfied
caprice, vengeance and treachery.</p>

<p>The Conde de Onis felt himself more in her power with
every day that dawned. The caresses of his lover were
tender, but her eyes, even in the moments of greatest
abandon, retained a cruel cat-like look; and his love was
strangely mingled with fear. Some times his superstitious
mind would make him wonder if this Valencian woman
were an incarnate devil of temptation.</p>

<p>After saying three or four times that he must go without
being able to break away from her, he at last got free from
her arms, and rose from the armchair. The farewell was
long as usual, for Amalia would not leave him until she saw
he was quite intoxicated with the power of her caresses.</p>

<p>Jacoba was expecting him outside the door. After taking<a name="Page_099" id="Page_099"></a>
him along several corridors, they came to the place of
the secret staircase leading into the library. Here she
signed to him to wait whilst she reconnoitered to see that
nobody was about the passages. Then she came back
again to tell him all was right, and the count went down
with as little noise as possible.</p>

<p>The intermediary left him at the passage after opening
the door. Then he bent down with his hands on the
ground to prevent any one seeing him from the street, and
so crossed the passage to the pew. He opened the door
and entered. The darkness blinded him. He made a few
steps forward, when he felt a sudden blow on his shoulder,
and a rough voice said in his ear, "Die, wretch!"</p>

<p>The blood froze in his veins, but he gave a spring forward
and saw a dark heap blacker than the darkness. Quick as
a dart it threw itself on him, and he would soon have done
for it with his enormous strength if he had not heard a stifled
laugh, and the voice of Amalia said:</p>

<p>"Take care, Luis, or you will hurt me!"</p>

<p>He was dumb with astonishment for some minutes.</p>

<p>"But how did you get here?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"By the front staircase. I popped on this black cap and
ran down."</p>

<p>Then, seeing that he looked cross and disgusted at a joke
in such bad taste, she stood on tiptoe, put her arms round
his neck, and after pressing a long and passionate kiss upon
his lips, she said, in a coaxing tone:</p>

<p>"Now I know that you are not a coward, but I wanted
to prove it."<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="head">THE JOKES OF PACO GOMEZ</p>


<p class="nind">I<span class="smcap">n</span> spite of all the efforts of Paco Gomez, Garnet could not
be made to believe that he was acting in good faith. His
jocose nature and the practical jokes he had been known
to perpetrate had made an unfavourable impression on the
Indian. It was in vain that he put on a grave and
circumspect manner and held long conversations on the
rise and fall of stocks, besides praising his house above all
modern buildings, and giving him valuable hints in the
game of <i>chapo</i>, the dandy of Lancia saw that there was no
dissipating the look of distrust in the old bear's bloodshot
eyes. In this dilemma he appealed to Manuel Antonio
for help, for he had such a delightful joke in his head that
any assistance seemed better than giving it up.</p>

<p>"Don't be so foolish, Santos," said the Chatterbox to him
one evening, as he was walking through the Bombé with
Garnet. "You see that as you have passed the half of your
life behind a counter you don't understand these Lancians.
I won't say Fernanda is deeply in love with you, but she is
going the way to be so. I tell you, and I say the same
everywhere, for I have remarked it for some time. Women
are capricious and incomprehensible; they reject a thing
one day, and want it the next, when they are then disposed
to stretch a point to get it. Fernanda began by snubbing
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In every possible way, in every possible way," returned
the Indian sullenly.<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></p>

<p>"Pure fancy, my man; she is a very proud girl who will
never make herself cheap. But proud as she may be, she
will marry either the Conde de Onis or you, the only two
matches there are in Lancia for her: the count with his
nobility and you with your money. But Luis is a strange
sort of man; I think he is quite incapable of marrying, and
I am sure she thinks so too. You are the only one left,
and you will be the one to get the prize. Besides, whatever
women may say, they admire great strong fellows like you;
why you are a perfect oak, my man," he added with a look
of admiration.</p>

<p>Garnet gave vent to a grunt of assent, and the Chatterbox
passed his hands over his body, as if he were a learned
connoisseur of the human masculine form.</p>

<p>"What muscles, my boy! What shoulders!"</p>

<p>"Yes, these shoulders have earned many thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"How? Carrying sacks?"</p>

<p>"Sacks!" exclaimed Garnet smiling scornfully. "They
are for the common herd. No, great cases of sugar like
waggons."</p>

<p>The Bombé was deserted at that hour. It was a large
promenade in the form of a drawing-room, which had been
recently built on the site of the famous wood of San
Francisco, from which there was a fine view. This wood
of large, old twisted oaks, some of which formed part of a
primeval forest, was where the monastery was founded
which gave its origin to Lancia, and it served as a place of
recreation and amusement to the town until the first houses
were built there. Then it fell into a state of neglect, until
the last municipal corporation carried out certain improvements
which won the hearts of all reforming spirits. They
made a promenade with little rustic gardens and a road
among the trees that led to the town. On weekdays
there was no one there but a few priests in long black
cloaks and large felt hats; the secular element was repre<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>sented
by two or three little parties of Indians discussing in
loud voices the price of shares, the value of certain plots of
ground in the Calle de Mauregato just opened, or some
valetudinarian come to get an hour's sunshine before the
chill of the afternoon.</p>

<p>And where were the ladies?</p>

<p>Oh! the ladies of Lancia know perfectly well what is due
to themselves, and they had far too great a regard for the
laws of good form to appear on days that were not fête
days; and even then they did not do it without taking
proper precautions.</p>

<p>No lady of Lancia would think of being so vulgar as to
go to the Bombé on a Sunday before the arrival of others
of her class; and it was a superhuman effort to arrange for
all to appear simultaneously. So after three o'clock in the
afternoon they were waiting about, gloved and bonneted,
peeping at each other out of the windows.</p>

<p>"The Zamoras are coming now!"</p>

<p>"There go the Mateos!"</p>

<p>And so they finally sallied forth in due dignity to the
promenade where the band had been performing different
fantasias on airs from "Ernani" or "Nabuco" for the
edification of the children and a few appreciative artisans.
It must not be thought that the distinguished society of
Lancia went with one rush to the open-air salon. Nothing
of the kind. Before putting foot there, they took a few
turns in a little walk a short way off. From thence they
took a survey, and ascertained whether anybody had yet
ventured as far as the promenade.</p>

<p>At last, by the time the shadows were falling amid the
old oaks, and the fog was gathering from the mountains,
and getting up the nostrils, in the throats, and down the
bronchial tubes of the people of high degree, all the local
beauties had assembled in crowds at the promenade. What
was a catarrh, a cold, or even inflammation of the lungs
compared to the disgrace of being the first at the Bombé!<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></p>

<p>What a wonderful example of fortitude! What an
instance of the power that self-respect exercises over the
minds of superior beings!</p>

<p>This exquisite sense of duty which Nature has written in
indelible characters on the hearts of the worthy, was shown
in a still more remarkable fashion at the private balls given
by the Casino of Lancia every fortnight during the
winter.</p>

<p>It will be easily surmised that none of the high-born
señoritas who demurred at appearing at the promenade
when it was empty, were likely to be the first to arrive at
the salon of the Casino. But as there was no side walk
here, from whence they could take a bird's-eye view, and
they could not keep a watch from the windows at night,
these clever young ladies, as high-born as they were
ingenious, hit upon a means of saving their honour.</p>

<p>Soon after ten o'clock, when the ball was supposed to
begin, they sent their papas or brothers on a little voyage
of discovery. They went in in a careless sort of way, sat
down in the armchairs, cut a few jokes with the raw youths
in buttoned up frock-coats who were impatiently standing
about, fastening each other's gloves, and then, making some
excuse, they soon retired to tell their families that nobody
had arrived yet.</p>

<p>Ah! how often did those young men in the frock-coats
wait the whole night in vain for the arrival of their beautiful
partners!</p>

<p>The candles burnt low, and the orchestra, after futilely
playing two or three dances, became quite demoralised;
and the musicians laughed and joked in loud tones, walked
about the room, and even smoked.</p>

<p>The maids and men-servants yawned and made allusions
to the blessing of sleep, and at last the president gave the
sign of dismissal, and the youths retired to their respective
homes as sad as they were conventional.</p>

<p>That was indeed a touching spectacle to see those heroic<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>
young girls sacrifice their great desire to go to the ball
rather than outrage the fundamental principles on which
the happiness and comfort of society are founded!</p>

<p>Paco then came in with the Pensioner.</p>

<p>"They will tell you the same as I," continued Manuel
Antonio, shading his eyes with his ivory white hand.</p>

<p>In the distance Paco really looked like a perch crowned
with a cucumber, for his head was so unusually small that
all his hats came down over his ears. Walking by his side
was Señor Mateo with his enormous white moustachios and
proud military bearing, although we know he was the
greatest civilian that Lancia had known for centuries.</p>

<p>Garnet gave a few grunts to express the profound contempt
with which the two persons inspired him, the one for
his want of conventionality, and the other for not having
even a paltry investment in the Three per Cents.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear fellows, and do me the favour of
making this stupid fellow believe that he is a good match
for any girl, although he will not believe it."</p>

<p>"Certainly; for if Don Santos is not a match with five
or six million reales, I don't know who is," exclaimed
Mateo feelingly, as befitted the father of four marriageable
daughters who did not marry.</p>

<p>"Draw it mild, Don Cristobal; draw it mild!" said the
Indian, with a stern look.</p>

<p>"What? Have you more, then? I am glad of it. I
only speak according to report."</p>

<p>"I have five hundred thousand dollars, and not a <i>lapiz</i><a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
less."</p>

<p>The three friends exchanged a significant look, and
Manuel Antonio, not being able to keep from laughing,
embraced him, saying:</p>

<p>"All right, Santos, all right! But this about the <i>lapiz</i>
quite affects me."</p>

<p>Garnet was a man who was continually tripping in his<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>
vocabulary. He really was ignorant of the proper way of
expressing many colloquial terms, and the result was often
very funny. Doubtless it was due to his not hearing well; it
was some years since he had left America, and consorted
with people of culture. His dreadful solecisms were quite
proverbial in Lancia.</p>

<p>"But this unhappy fellow surely does not think," continued
the Chatterbox, regardless of Garnet's resentful look,
"that because Fernanda Estrada-Rosa is a bit coquettish,
that he is not taken with her little set-up airs like every other
man! Fool, fool, more than fool!" and so saying he gave
him a few taps on the large red nape of his neck. "Besides
she is a daughter of Don Juan Estrada-Rosa, the greatest
Jew in the province!"</p>

<p>"But, man, Fernanda is quite different," said the Pensioner,
who was not in the plot. "She is a very rich girl, and there
is no need for her to marry for money."</p>

<p>Then the others came down upon him with a vengeance:
Where there is money more is wanted. Ambition is
insatiable. Fernanda was very proud, and she would never
stand being outdone in show by any other girl in Lancia.
Now if Don Santos chose a wife in the town she would
find her such a formidable rival that it would be a continual
annoyance to her. The only person Don Santos had to
fear was the Count of Onis, but he seemed to have gone off,
for his eccentric character, and the strange attacks to which
he was frequently subject, had ended by disgusting the young
girl.</p>

<p>Won over by these arguments, backed up by nods of
intelligence from Paco, the Pensioner saw the wisdom of the
idea, and went over to their side, and then the three
tried their best to persuade the Indian that no young girl
would hold out long against him, if he once laid siege
to her.</p>

<p>Paco alluded mysteriously to certain information in his
possession, which was the strongest evidence that the girl's<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
treatment of him was nothing but little airs of vanity put on
to make herself more valuable. But it was a secret, he
said, which could not be revealed without a breach of
the confidence and regard due to the friend who had revealed
it.</p>

<p>In spite of all this Garnet would not give in. He was like
a mastiff under the caresses and turbulent treatment of
children, for he only cast angry looks at his tormentors, and
every now and then gave vent to ominous growls.</p>

<p>Manuel Antonio repeated the list of his subtle arguments,
enforcing them with sundry embraces, pats, and pinches,
for he was eloquent and plausible to a degree. Paco let
Manuel go on, taking care to give him many a sly corroborative
wink, for he was certain that Garnet had no confidence
in his remarks. But he came in with the final stroke.
After having had himself implored and entreated by his two
allies, who promised eternal secrecy by the nails of Christ,
he finally drew a letter from his pocket. It was from
Fernanda to a friend at Nieva. After casually explaining
how it came into his hands, Paco read with the bated breath
of mystery:</p>

<p>"There is no foundation in what you say of Luis. I
have not renewed, nor do I wish to renew, my relations
with him, and this for reasons too many to be given, and
some of which you know. The suit of Don Santos, as there
is nobody else, has a far better chance. He is certainly
old for me, but very conventional and affectionate. I should
not be surprised if I ended by having him."</p>

<p>Garnet listened with great attention, opening his eyes
unusually wide with astonishment. When Paco finished, he
said in a deep voice, "This letter is <i>ipocryphal</i>."</p>

<p>The three friends turned round in surprise, and great was
their difficulty to keep from laughing, whilst Manuel Antonio
improved the occasion by giving Don Santos another
embrace and saying:</p>

<p>"Go to, you rude, mistrustful thing! Show him the letter,<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>
Paco. Do you not know Fernanda's writing? Emilita is
constantly having letters from her. You are too modest,
Santos. I will not say you are a perfect gentleman, but
you have a certain grace and a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think so!" exclaimed Paco; "and you
take what Manuel Antonio says, for he is a judge."</p>

<p>"There are some who can tell at once, my dear fellow,"
continued the latter, in a quick voice. "They have only to
cast their eyes on a face and they know whether it is
handsome, ugly, or mediocre."</p>

<p>But not wishing to waste any more breath in forwarding
Paco's plans they left Garnet in peace, and the Chatterbox
changed the conversation.</p>

<p>"Ah! here come some friends of yours, Don Cristobal!"</p>

<p>And raising his head the Pensioner saw eight or ten
soldiers approaching. They were officers of the battalion
of Pontevedra, which, to his disgust, had recently arrived
for the garrison of the town.</p>

<p>Mateo gnashed his teeth, and gave utterance to sounds
indicative of his hatred of the armed force, and then exclaimed
in an ironical tone:</p>

<p>"How delightful to see warriors in time of peace!"</p>

<p>"You are quite cracked about them, Don Cristobal.
Soldiers are very useful."</p>

<p>"Useful!" exclaimed the Pensioner, in a rage. "What
use are they I should like to know? How are they useful?"</p>

<p>"They keep the peace, man."</p>

<p>"They keep war, you mean. The Civil Guard can keep
us from rogues, but they foment dissensions and cause the
ruin of the country. Directly they see the enemy appear,
they take care to go off in another direction, and then they
get appointments, crosses, and pensions. I maintain that
as long as there are soldiers, there will be no peace in
Spain."</p>

<p>"But, Don Cristobal, supposing a foreign nation attacked
us?"<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></p>

<p>The Pensioner gave an ironical smile and shook his head
several times before replying.</p>

<p>"Get along, silly; why the only country that could
attack us by land is France, and if France should ever do
so, what good would these stupid little officers in uniform
be to us?"</p>

<p>"Well, apart from that, soldiers are good for trade.
The shops profit by them, and the hotel-keepers benefit
also."</p>

<p>Manuel Antonio only defended the military to aggravate
Mateo, but there was a shade of irony in his present
remarks that was excessively aggravating.</p>

<p>"That is just what it is! And it is that which annoys
me so, for where does the money come from that they
spend, you foolish fellow? Why, from you and from me,
and from that gentleman; in fact, from every one who pays
anything to the State in one form or another. The result is
that they spend without producing, and so set a bad
example in the towns; for idleness is a corrupting influence
to those that are inclined to be lazy. Do you know what
the army costs? Why, the naval and military Ministers
take between them half of the national grant. That is to
say, justice, religion, the expenses of the maintenance of our
relations with other countries, and the working of all
material interests, do not take as much to keep as these
scarlet trousered young gentlemen. If other nations of
Europe have a great army, what is that to do with it? Let
them have it. Besides, they can allow themselves this
luxury because they have money. But we are a poor little
nation with only outside show. Besides, in other countries
there are international complications, from which we are
fortunately free. France is too afraid of the intervention of
other countries to attack us, but if perchance it did attack
us, it would conquer us just as much with an army as without
one."</p>

<p>The Pensioner was very emphatic in his arguments, which,<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>
with his eyes blazing with anger, he enforced with vehement
gesticulations of the hands.</p>

<p>Manuel Antonio was delighted at seeing him get into a
rage; and at that moment the little company of officers
passed near with a polite "Good-day," which they all
returned excepting Don Cristobal, who took no notice of
the greeting.</p>

<p>"I really think you go too far, Don Cristobal. Now
what do you think of Captain Nuñez who has just gone
by? Is he not a perfect gentleman with courteous, pleasant
manners?"</p>

<p>"He would be better with a pickaxe in his hand, and
more useful to his country," returned the Pensioner
crossly.</p>

<p>"But what is the good of putting yourself out when,
according to report, he is going to be your son-in-law, as
he is going to marry Emilita?" said the Chatterbox with
mischievous delight.</p>

<p>Paco and Don Santos burst out laughing, for Don
Cristobal was quite crushed, and with great difficulty he
said:</p>

<p>"Whoever heard such nonsense!" and then relapsed
into silence, for the news was a dreadful blow, as it put him
in the most awkward position.</p>

<p>The silence was noticed by the others, who winked and
smiled behind his back.</p>

<p>But Paco was also pre-occupied, for when he had a
practical joke in that little knob of a head of his, he was as
restless and full of thought as a poet or painter with some
great work on hand; and it was only after working hard for
some days, that he all but won over the Indian to his plan;
and the question of his going formally to ask Don Juan
Estrada-Rosa for his daughter's hand in marriage was
actually under discussion. According to Paco and his
supporters, that was considered the most direct way, and
best calculated to succeed, for any other seemed round<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>-about.
The day that Don Juan should see him come
forward with his ten millions and an offer of marriage, he
would spare no means to make his daughter consent, and
she herself would not be averse. For as they could not
have the Conde de Onis, who could she marry better than
a man so rich, so proper, so robust, so <i>illustrious</i>? This
last epithet, gravely suggested by Paco, nearly spoilt the
whole thing, as he was splitting with suppressed laughter.
Garnet noticing this fact cast an angry glance at him, and as
his confidence was again shaken, a delay of some days
ensued.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the moment arrived when the Indian gave
credence to his words through overhearing him from a
neighbouring room speak plainly to the Conde de Onis.
From that day he put faith in him, and consulted him as to
how to bring about his purpose. Paco said it was better
not to mention it first to the girl.</p>

<p>As good generals surprise the enemy and conquer by a
bold, unexpected stroke, it was the unanimous opinion that
the best course would be to call on Don Juan, ask for a
private interview and go straight to the point. There was
no fear but what the banker would jump at the idea; the
girl would probably be somewhat surprised, but under the
influence of her father she would soon give in. The
important things of life were generally decided by a bold
stroke&mdash;"nothing venture nothing have."</p>

<p>Finally, Garnet gave in, and commenced proceedings with
all due solemnity. The first thing to be considered was
the hour at which it would be best to call, and twelve o'clock
was finally decided on. His costume was also a subject of
deep discussion; and Paco maintained that he would look
most imposing in uniform, such as that worn by an honorary
chief of the civil administration. It would not be difficult
to get a nomination if he paid handsomely for it, but it
could not be done under a month's delay, so the uniform
had to be given up, and it was settled he was to wear a<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>
black frock-coat with his medal as town-councillor; the day
was the last thing to be arranged, which was fixed for
Monday. In the meanwhile the traitor Paco lost no time in
letting out in conversation with Don Juan Estrada-Rosa that
Garnet was hoping and wishing to be accepted as his son-in-law.
Don Juan, who was rich as well as proud, and so adored
his daughter that he thought a duke at least would come
from Madrid to ask her hand in marriage, was furious,
called him an impudent fellow, and swore that sooner than
let her marry such a boor he would rather she remained unmarried.</p>

<p>"Well, then, take care, Don Juan," said Paco smiling
maliciously, "for the day will come when least expected
when he will appear at your house to ask for Fernanda's
hand."</p>

<p>"He will do nothing of the sort," returned the banker,
"he knows too well that he would be kicked downstairs."</p>

<p>Having taken all these precautions, the terrible practical
joker of Lancia felt he was quite secure. With the exception
of the three or four friends who helped him to persuade
Don Santos, nobody knew about his plot. But the Sunday
afternoon preceding the event, he and Manuel Antonio went
round and told people about the joke, and said that they
had better be at the Café Marañón the next day if they
wanted to see it out. In the provinces, where there are not
many amusements, these practical jokes are made quite a
business, and much time and thought are given to their
conception and organisation.</p>

<p>The youths of Lancia were delighted at Paco's project, for
it presented especial attraction, the victim not being a poor
fellow whom they might feel for, but a rich man; and in
the depth of every heart there is always a grain of hatred for
any one who has much money. So the news got bruited
about, and on the following day there were more than fifty
young fellows at the Café Marañón. But they did not
make themselves conspicuous until Garnet appeared. The<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
café was situated on a first floor (for the ground floors were
never used at that time for such a purpose) in the Calle de
Altavilla, almost opposite Don Juan Estrada-Rosa's house,
which was large and sumptuous, although not so much so as
the one that Don Santos had recently built, and that
where the café was, was old and dilapidated. The resort
of customers was a room, where there was a billiard-table,
and two little side rooms furnished with little wooden tables
for refreshment, all dirty, murky and shabby. How different
were those times to the magnificent Café Britanico of today
in the same street, with marble tables, colossal mirrors and
gilded columns like the finest in Madrid!</p>

<p>Spying through the little windows the gay assembly of
youths, eager for excitement, saw Garnet pass by correctly
dressed, balancing his colossal body on legs that looked too
small for it. They saw him enter Estrada-Rosa's house, and
heard the sound of the door being shut upon him. Nothing
more was seen, but the windows of the café were simultaneously
opened and filled. Those who could find no place got
up on seats behind their companions. Every eye was fixed
on the opposite door, and thus they waited for a quarter of
an hour. At the end of that time the purple face of Garnet
reappeared. It was indeed a fearful sight. It looked just
as if the man had been nearly strangled, and his ears were
the colour of blood. A perfect storm of coughs, shouts and
howls greeted his appearance. The Indian turned his head
and gave an astonished look at the excited crowd who were
laughing for some unknown reason at him. But he was
not long before he saw that he was the victim of a practical
joke. His eyes glared fiercely round, and he burst out in
a fit of intolerable rage:</p>

<p>"Liars!"</p>

<p>And he then fled like a wild boar pursued by a pack of
hounds, amid the hisses and laughter of the youths, only
turning his head from time to time to repeat the strong
expletive.<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></p>

<p class="head">THE SEÑORITAS DE MERÉ</p>


<p class="nind">S<span class="smcap">o</span> Emilita Mateo had really won the heart of a captain of
the battalion of Pontevedra. But it had not been done
without several days' hard work, in the way of coy glances,
aimless laughter, childish pranks, mincing ways and numberless
little tricks. She had, in short, called all her forces into
play, being by turns straightforward and malicious, kind
and rude, reserved and teasing, grave and frolicsome, like a
wild thing, like a silly irresponsible child, but none the less
adorable.</p>

<p>Finally Nuñez, Captain Nuñez could not resist such a
provoking mixture of innocence and guile; he was first taken
with her, and ended by falling in love. He was a man with
a wide face, lean, grave, and bilious looking, having a
moustache and imperial, and languid, dull looking eyes,
very conscientious in his duties, and very fond of taking long
walks. This type of silent, conventional man is most susceptible
to the charm of cheerfulness and vivacity. Emilita
won his heart by calling him grumpy, giving him pinches by
way of teasing him, saying that his words had to be drawn
out with a corkscrew, and letting him have the full benefit of
her chaff.</p>

<p>The family of Mateos was quite upset by this wonderful
success. Jovita, Micaela and Socorro, being elder sisters of
the happy maiden, were both jealous and flattered. They
felt that the preference of such a gallant infantry officer was
an honour which was reflected over the whole family, and<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>
placed them in a superior position in the eyes of their friends
and acquaintances. But at the same time, considering that
Emilita was the youngest, they did not like her having a
lover, or being married before themselves. It was decidedly
premature for her to be engaged, as she was not more than
twenty-four, and a smile of scorn and surprise contracted
the lips of the three elder sisters at the idea of such an
innocent, unconventional creature being married. So that
although they sang the captain's praises to their friends,
speaking highly of his personal attractions, crediting him with
a brave and generous heart, testifying to his riches, as if
they managed his exchequer, and vaguely referring to certain
influential patronage which would put him, sooner or later,
in the way of the distinctions of a general, they certainly
never forgave him his chronological error.</p>

<p>On the other side Don Cristobal, the father of that perverse,
coquettish angel, found himself suddenly in such an
awkward position that it nearly drove him mad. He was
ashamed at having to give his consent to a daughter of his
being courted by a soldier after having so often called the
military idle and bloodthirsty, and having clamoured for
the reduction of the army. How would he be able to face
all his friends in the future? Many dreadful days of doubt
ensued. His hatred against the army and the marines was
so deeply rooted in his heart that it could not be eradicated
in a moment. Nevertheless, he was obliged to confess that
the very noble behaviour of Captain Nuñez had influenced
him to a great extent. The wish of seeing his daughters
married was quite as strong as his dislike of the armed
force. In his worry he deplored Nuñez having a commission
in the infantry. If he could only have been a
sailor the gravity of the situation would have been so much
lessened. He recollected that in his diatribes against the
army, he had admitted that a few ships contributed to the
safety of the colonies. The same thing applied to the
civil guard, but as to the rest of the land forces there<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>
was no excuse, there was no means of getting out of the
dilemma.</p>

<p>Under such awkward circumstances he elected to shut
himself up at home. The engagement of his daughter got
spread abroad and became a settled affair, and he was
afraid of practical jokes. Fear made him take the false
step of playing fast and loose, which was unworthy of his
character and antecedents. That is to say, that whilst continuing
publicly to affect a scorn of the land forces, when
talking with his daughter's bridegroom or other military
men, he was quite suave and showed as much interest in the
questions he asked them about their profession, as if they
served in some civil office of the State. Nobody would
have thought, to hear him enter into the details of the
active, reserve, and militia forces, that the man entertained
an eternal, undying hate against them. But the Pensioner
attained a greater perfection in his rôle than anybody could
have dared to expect. He did not pretend to get on with
them as soldiers, when he considered them a social plague,
but as men they might, according to their qualities, be
worthy of esteem.</p>

<p>The love affair of Emilita, like that of many others, had
begun and gone on in the house of the Merés. These were
two señoritas past eighty years of age, and not yet a hundred.
From all accounts, they were already grown up at
the beginning of the nineteenth century. They had no
relations in Lancia, and nobody recollected their father,
who died when they were little girls. He had held some
appointment in the Exchequer department. It is possible,
from its remote date, that he was a collector of the excise or
some other taxes now extinct.</p>

<p>In the first place the dress of these interesting señoritas
savoured of the eighteenth century, to which they belonged.
They could not put up with the fashions of the present day.
They wore straight black gowns with lead sewn at the
bottom to prevent their turning up, very long waisted bodies,<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>
tight sleeves with puffs, low cashmere shoes, and a coiffure
too funny for anything. The mantilla they adopted was
not of net, but of serge with a velvet fringe, such as is only
worn by the working classes; and they carried a stick as a
support.</p>

<p>They affected a perfect courtesy, a versatility of character,
and an insatiable passion for society and gaiety perfectly
astonishing at their age. They certainly had not retained
in the present century the licence of manners and wickedness
which, according to historians, characterised the society
of the past. It would be impossible to imagine creatures
more simple. They seemed quite ignorant of life, everything
surprised them, and they could not believe in evil.
Thus they were frequently the victims of practical jokes at
the hands of their friends and guests, without either of them
expressing any great surprise at it. From time immemorial
they had been accustomed to open their house of an evening
to the young people of Lancia, who were attracted by
the liberty prevalent there.</p>

<p>The custom of <i>tutoyant</i> everybody was tacitly allowed,
and it was curious to hear young men of eighteen years of
age talking so familiarly to old ladies who might have been
their great-grandmothers. It was Carmelita here, and Nuncita
there, because the eldest was named Doña Carmen,
and the youngest Doña Anunciacion. Three or four
generations had passed through that little drawing-room
of the Calle del Carpo, so modest and neat, with its
polished wood floors, straw-bottomed chairs, red damask
sofa, mahogany sideboard with branch candlesticks, its
tortoiseshell framed mirror, and several little pictures in
pastels representing the story of Romeo and Juliet. The
reception of the de Merés was the oldest institution
of Lancia, and, contrary to the usual course of things,
these old ladies who had not been able to marry themselves,
had a perfect mania for helping everybody else to marry.
Innumerable were the marriages due to that little drawing-<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>room.
Directly they heard that a young man was more
attracted to one young lady than another, our señoritas set
to work preparing the noose which was to unite them with
an indissoluble bond. Indeed, they would allow no one to
have the chair by a certain lady's side, so that when a
certain gentleman should come it should be all ready for him,
and he would only have to take it. Then they were loud in
their praises of a certain gentleman to a certain lady, and
would go to a certain gentleman full of the wonders of a
certain lady's cleverness, economy, handiness, piety, and
beauty. Then they repaired to the house of a certain young
lady's mamma, where they had long private, important
conversations, and they bearded a certain young gentleman's
papa, when all their diplomatic arts were brought into
play to soften his heart. And the reward of all these efforts
was a little box of sweets on the day of the marriage!
So all the mothers of marriageable girls adored the old
ladies, and blessings and praises were showered upon them.
They were hailed half a mile off, and on coming out of
church, matrons hastened to offer them an arm as a
support.</p>

<p>But, on the other side, those who had any son of a marriageable
age, regarded them with distrust and dislike, and
dubbed them as interfering intermediaries.</p>

<p>When the first touch of love was felt in the heart of some
susceptible youth, he repaired immediately to the abode of
the Las Merés.</p>

<p>"Carmelita, I am in love!"</p>

<p>"With whom, my heart, with whom?" asked the elder
with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>"With Rosario Calvo."</p>

<p>"Aha! The rogue has good taste. There isn't a
prettier or better educated girl. You were born for one
another."</p>

<p>And then the young fellow had the pleasure of hearing
for some time panegyrics on his adored one.<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></p>

<p>"I hope that you will help me."</p>

<p>"As much as you like, dear heart."</p>

<p>So at the end of a few days Rosario Calvo, who
had never before set foot in the house of the de Merés,
became a regular <i>habituée</i> of the evening gatherings. However
did they manage to get the girl there? It is difficult
to say, but they had brought so many affairs to a
successful issue that they certainly must have had some
simple, sure recipe. They were as affectionate to their
friends as if they were all near relations. Stories of self-abnegation
were told of them which did them great honour.
During the dreadful revolution of 1823, one of their guests,
a cavalry lieutenant, took refuge in their house. The
señoritas received him, and hid him for some days, and
finally he escaped in the clothes of the servant. But hearing
that the police were going to search the house, they
were terror-struck at the thought of the lieutenant's uniform
being found. Where could it be hidden so as not to betray
him? Carmelita at this critical moment hit upon a brilliant,
brave idea. She put on the uniform herself underneath her
female attire. And yet this lieutenant treated them with
such ingratitude that he never all his life found ten minutes
to write them a letter of thanks.</p>

<p>But this was not the only act of ingratitude on the part of
their guests, who made as much use of their kindness as
they could, enjoyed the company and conversation of the
prettiest girls in Lancia, arranged matrimonial alliances, and
directly all this business was concluded, they found that
their affairs or their position precluded their frequenting
the parties any more, and they scarcely greeted them
when they met their old hostesses in the street. The
same can be said of the mammas, who made so much of
the señoritas before marrying their daughters, and dropped
them when that was done. But this neglectful conduct
neither damped the kindness of the good ladies nor quelled
their optimistic spirit. They kept up an incessant stream<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>
of new-comers to their house, and whilst forgetting the
ingratitude of the old ones, they set their minds on the
worthiness that they attributed to the new. Besides, they
harboured no rancour or ill-feeling in their hearts, and they
were not even offended at practical jokes, although some of
them were really very serious. Paco Gomez arranged one
that was so startling that it is still told in Lancia with gusto.</p>

<p>Ladies could not go to the parties every evening in the
winter, they generally went on Saturdays and Wednesdays.
But there were a few young men who hardly ever missed
going at an early hour, even if they went on to other houses
afterwards. On these quiet evenings a game of <i>brisca</i> was
generally got up. Paco took Nuncita as a partner, and
Captain Nuñez, or some other young fellow, Carmelita.
But one evening they were regretting that the signs made
during the game were so common and hackneyed, that it
was impossible to make them unnoticed by the opponents.
So both sides agreed to change them. Paco taught some
to Nuncita, and the opponent several more to Carmelita.
But these new signs were all so improper that they are
only seen in taverns and bad houses. Yet those innocent
women took them as a matter of course in perfect unconcern.
Some days went by and they were quite accustomed
to their use, when Paco suggested a game to several of the
guests. Then ensued a scene of comic surprise. Every
time one of the two señoritas made a sign, there was an
explosion of merriment. And instead of showing the door
to the cruel shameless author of the joke, and forbidding
his ever returning, the kind señoritas only crossed themselves
in surprise, and laughed with the others when they
found it out.</p>

<p>"Blessed Santo Cristo of Rodillero! Whoever would have
thought it! So we have committed all these sins in
ignorance!"</p>

<p>"I shall not confess them, then," exclaimed Nuncita, with
determination.<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></p>

<p>"You will confess them, child," returned the elder,
severely.</p>

<p>"But I won't."</p>

<p>"Child!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to."</p>

<p>"Silence, child, you will confess them three times. To-morrow
I shall take you myself to Fray Diego."</p>

<p>Nuncita still protested under her breath like a wilful
child, until the severe glances of her elder sister made her
be silent, but she was still in a pet. Sometimes without
any reason she had these exhibitions of ill-temper
and rebellion, and Carmelita had to call all her authority
into play to bring her to reason, but this was a rare
occurrence. Although only three or four years older
than herself, Nuncita, from long custom, weakness of character,
or maybe from liking to appear young before people,
recognised her sister's authority and accorded her an
obedience and submission that many mothers of daughters
would envy. It was seldom necessary to call her to order,
but when it was so, Nuncita bowed her head, and was soon
seen to put her handkerchief to her eyes and leave the
room, whilst Carmelita followed her movements with a fixed
look and shook her head severely. A little more, and she
would have chastised her in public and sent her to bed
without any supper. For such reasons, and because Doña
Carmelita frequently called her so, Doña Nuncita, who was
over eighty years of age, went by the name of "the child"
in Lancia.</p>

<p>Both sisters worked heroically in the love affair of
Emilita Mateo, and Captain Nuñez was besieged in the
regular way. For a month at least, until they saw he was
well under weigh, no chair was left vacant for him excepting
by the side of Don Cristobal's youngest girl. In the game
of lottery, which was a perfect passion in that society,
Nuncita took care that papers should be found with their
names combined. When reference was made to the officer<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
and Emilita they were mentioned as one person, already
united and inseparable. Services of such great importance
were repaid by the Pensioner by a gratitude which beamed
from his eyes, and he would gladly have prostrated himself
at their feet and kissed the edge of their square gowns.
But his dignity and his long series of diatribes against
the army chained his feet and forbade these, and all other
manifestations of delight. He was deprived even of the
consolation of exhibiting pleasure at the sight of the soldier
at the promenade with his daughter. But we know that
the señoritas cared little for the gratitude of their guests.
They married them from their irresistible propensity in
this direction, which was as much a necessity of their
constitution as web-spinning is to the spider, or singing in
the woods is to the birds. Once launched in matrimony,
the men and women guests lost all attraction for the
Señoritas de Meré. Their attention was immediately
turned to the fresh young people who came and took
refuge under their protecting wings. But there was one
who caused them such bitter disappointment that a little
more would have brought them to the grave. Never in
their lives had they come across such an incomprehensible
man as the count. What the poor things went through to
put him in the right path, in the flowery path of Hymen!
But the devil slipped through their fingers like an eel.</p>

<p>For some evenings he appeared tender and devoted to
Fernanda, never leaving her side for an instant. The
glances of the two sisters were then fixed upon them
with visible interest; by dint of signs they kept them from
interruption, a little more and they would have requested
the others to lower their voices, so that the noise should
not disturb them. And then suddenly when least expected
the count was absurd enough to leave his seat in an
absent-minded way with a yawn, and walk off by himself
and sit at a corner of the table; whilst Fernanda, on her side,
was also very whimsical, for she would take the opportunity<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>
to start an animated conversation with the son of the
Chief Magistrate of the Court without vouchsafing a look
at her <i>fiancé</i>. Carmelita and Nuncita were taken aback
when this occurred, and they retired to rest full of consternation.
After the final break, and when they were
quite certain that the chance of bringing such a magnificent
marriage to pass was not reserved for them, they lowered
their ambition and turned their attention to Garnet who had
been pressing for their help for some time.</p>

<p>But impious fate was again against them. Fernanda
snubbed any conciliatory remark that they made to her in
favour of the Indian. If she noticed that the señoritas
arranged the chairs, so that he would have to sit by her
side, she instantly upset their man&oelig;uvres and skilfully
managed for a contrary effect. When sides were arranged
for <i>brisca</i> or <i>tute</i> she would not accept him as a partner and
preferred to give up the game than do so. In short
she was so quick and wide awake that she was invincible
on every side. Nevertheless, the de Merés persisted
in their project, and worked for its accomplishment with
the patience which is the surest means for the success of
great undertakings.</p>

<p>Some days after the practical joke of Paco Gomez on
Don Santos, there assembled at the famous party, besides
three or four youths, the same Paco, Manuel Antonio, Don
Santos, Captain Nuñez, Don Cristobal, Maria Josefa
Hevia, and two of the Mateo girls.</p>

<p>They were not yet thinking of playing. They were all
seated excepting Paco, who was walking up and down the
drawing-room, telling them the joke he had the other night
at the theatre with Manin the majordomo of Quiñones.
Since the latter had been paralysed, his well-known
companion had to go about the town without his shadow.
But in consideration of the regard shown him by his
master, the guests of Don Pedro took a good deal of notice
of him, and in spite of the rusticity of his manners and the<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>
countrified aspect of his attire, they greeted him familiarly
when they met him in the street, invited him into a café,
and sometimes took him to the theatre. It was Manin
here, and Manin there, the great peasant had made himself
famous, not only in Lancia, but in the whole of the
province. Those short breeches, those white woollen
stockings with coloured stripes, that green cloth jacket
and wide brimmed hat, gave him an original aspect in the
town, where it would be difficult to find a man in such
attire.</p>

<p>He was an unfailing source of astonishment to strangers,
especially as they saw him associate on an equal footing
with the señores of the place; for they seemed to seek his
society not only out of respect for the Grandee, but
because they found pleasure in Manin's uncouth manners.
Besides, Manin was a celebrated bear-hunter, and it was
reported that he had occasionally had deadly struggles with
the beasts. Those who were partial to that kind of sport
professed great regard and respect for him. Nevertheless,
the enemies that the majordomo had in his village laughed
sarcastically, and said that the bears were all a farce, and
he had never seen one in his life, much less struggled with
them. They added that Manin had never been anything
more than a country clown, until Don Pedro took it into
his head to raise him from his obscure position.</p>

<p>Impartiality obliges us to give this evidence, but we can
take it for what it is worth. It must, however, be confessed
that the conduct of Manin gave it a semblance of truth, for
although he often offered to take his friends bear-hunting,
he never kept his promise. But perhaps this was due to
his respect for the well-being and safety of the bears of his
country. Is it sufficient evidence for dubbing a man a
mere country clown? Nobody could say so. It would be
more logical to assume that the celebrated Manin, like
everybody who rises above the common herd, was a victim
of the insinuations of the envious.<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></p>

<p>So Paco, with his usual freedom, quite regardless of the
presence of ladies, told how he and some other friends who
had a theatre ticket took Manin to the stage box. The
majordomo had never before seen women dancers. When
they first appeared on the scene, Manin, thinking that they
had bare legs, was perfectly scandalised and fixed his eyes,
glowing with anger and indignation, upon them. "But
you have not seen the best," Paco said, "wait a bit." When
the orchestra began to play, the dancers shook their
castanettes, and with a turn they raised their legs as high
as their heads. "Shame!" exclaimed the poor fellow,
clapping his hands to his face. "What will happen
next?"</p>

<p>Paco told the story quite naturally, as he walked up and
down the drawing-room, with his head down, and his hands
in his trousers-pockets. The young ladies felt inclined to
blush, and everybody laughed excepting Garnet, who was
still smarting from the joke of the other day.</p>

<p>From his corner, where he sat like a sulky bear, he cast
grim and angry glances at Paco. What had happened in
Estrada-Rosa's house, when the Indian went to ask for the
hand of the señorita? Not a word could be got out of Don
Juan nor his daughter; but a certain little servant-maid
informed the world that Don Juan refused him with the
deepest scorn, that Garnet made mention of his millions and
maintained that Fernanda would never have a chance of a
better marriage. Then Don Juan got in a rage, called him
a sponger, and sent him off with offensive epithets. Every
time Paco caught one of the angry glances, he smiled and
winked at Manuel Antonio.</p>

<p>"I say, Carmela," he said, coming to a stand before a
little picture painted in oils, "where did you buy this San
Juan?"</p>

<p>"Jesus! señor," exclaimed Carmelita; "it is not a San
Juan, but a Salvador! See how the poor little fellow is
laughing!"<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></p>

<p>"Ah! so it is a Salvador. What is the difference?"</p>

<p>The Señoritas de Meré, hearing such a question, went
nearly wild with amusement. They laughed till the tears
came.</p>

<p>"Ay, what, Paquito! Ay, what, my heart! You don't
know the difference between a San Juan and a Salvador?"</p>

<p>And they laughed and laughed again. They had not
heard anything so funny for many years. When they were
a little more composed, they dried their tears and used
their handkerchiefs vigorously. Paco, who liked to see them
so merry, went on to inquire:</p>

<p>"But come, when did you buy this Salvador, that I never
saw till now?"</p>

<p>"It was in Nuncia's room, my dear; but it did not do
there, because it came in the way of the bed, and so we
put it here."</p>

<p>"It was given to Carmela when papa was alive," said
Nuncita, "by a painter from Madrid who spent a few days
here."</p>

<p>"Were you young then?" asked Paco, gravely, turning to
Carmelita.</p>

<p>"Yes, very young."</p>

<p>"Was the painter famous?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Then I know who it was. It was Murillo."</p>

<p>"No; I don't think that was his name."</p>

<p>"Then it was Velasquez."</p>

<p>"That name sounds more like it. He was a young man,
very short, and very gallant. Was he not, Nuncia?"</p>

<p>"Did he not address some soft words to you?"</p>

<p>Nuncita lowered her eyes and blushed.</p>

<p>"Who would recollect these things now?"</p>

<p>"He was very much in love," continued Carmelita;
"and at the same time he was most well-bred and
clever."<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></p>

<p>"Of an amorous disposition, did you say? It can be no
other than Velasquez."</p>

<p>"He was not named Velasquez, he was called Gonzalez,"
interposed Nuncita, timidly.</p>

<p>And after this remark she blushed again.</p>

<p>"That's it! Gonzalez!" exclaimed her sister, recollecting.</p>

<p>"Well, it is all the same; he would be a contemporary of
his&mdash;of the great race of painters of the seventeenth century,"
remarked Paco, not the least put out by the laughter
of the guests, who were astonished at the innocence of the
poor women.</p>

<p>"How did he make love to thee?" he continued, with a
caressing touch of Nuncita's cheek. "It seems to me you
were very coquettish, eh, Carmela?"</p>

<p>This remark was provocative of a smile from the company.</p>

<p>"Carmela, <i>por Dios</i>! and are these gentlemen going to
make believe I was a coquette?" exclaimed the "child" in
real concern.</p>

<p>"They would only believe the truth, girl," said Paco.
"Now, don't you recollect you lent a willing ear to the
ecclesiastical attorney, called Don Maximo, and no sooner
had he left the house than you were talking on the balcony
with Lieutenant Paniagua?"</p>

<p>Nuncita smiled with pleasure at the recollection of those
times, and replied as she lowered her eyes with gracious
timidity:</p>

<p>"Don Maximo came to the house every day, but it was
never a question of love."</p>

<p>"Neither a courtship nor a refusal?" asked Paco. "Then
confess that the one you really liked was the lieutenant, and
done with it."</p>

<p>"What! you were in love with a soldier?" asked Emilita,
with pleasant volubility, as she cast a teasing glance at
Nuñez. "Then you must have had bad taste."</p>

<p>The Pensioner became suddenly serious and his moustache<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>
went up in horror at his daughter's sally, but he was immediately
calmed at seeing that the captain, instead of being
offended, only returned a loving smile, and like all the rest
treated it as a joke.</p>

<p>"She is not the only one who has had such bad taste,"
said Carmelita, with marked insinuation, delighted at the
chance of making such a clever hit.</p>

<p>"And who was this lieutenant? Some useless puppy,
like we have here?" continued Emilia, with the same taking
levity.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, Emilia!" returned Paco. "Paniagua
was lieutenant of the third regiment of infantry of Flanders,
and a very brave man."</p>

<p>"No, dear, no," interposed Nuncita, "to put the matter
right, he was of the Royal Guard."</p>

<p>"Was he not an archer?"</p>

<p>"No, dear heart, I say he was of the Royal Guard."</p>

<p>Don Cristobal hid his amusement under a fit of coughing,
and Manuel Antonio and the young people laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"Paniagua was a very remarkable man," continued Paco.
"He was endowed with a decision of character befitting
soldiers. The day that he arrived, he saw Nuncia at the
window in the morning, and in the evening he managed to
give her, in the portico of San Rafael after <i>nones</i>, a letter of
declaration which ran thus:</p>

<p>"'Señorita, in confusion and fear and doubting if in your
kind condescension you will pardon my boldness, I confess
that my only joy is in loving you.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! you rogue! what a memory you have!" exclaimed
Nuncita, now fairly overcome.</p>

<p>The fact was, Paco, to whom, after many entreaties, "the
child" had shown the letters she had kept of Paniagua's,
learnt the original document by heart and recited it everywhere
to the great delight of his friends.</p>

<p>"He was what may be called a resolute man. The<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>
character of a person is shown like that. How different to
the soldiers of the present day, who before proposing to a
girl, dangle about for a whole year and then delay saying:
'Child, when shall we go to church?'"</p>

<p>These words were uttered with a look at the corner,
where Emilita and the captain were sitting. The latter
took the remark and became serious, and the girl tried to
look unconscious although grateful in her heart to Paco for
giving the hint; whilst the Pensioner twisted his moustache
with a trembling hand, fearing that Nuñez would take
offence, but glad with the hope that these opportune allusions
would bring him to the point.</p>

<p>Tired of conversation, the young people proposed a game
of forfeits. It is a game which wide-awake men always
turn to their own advantage.</p>

<p>Fernanda let Garnet sit by her side. She was vexed at
the winks and signs of Paco that she had noticed. She was
a very proud creature, but she prided herself on her sense
of justice. She could not bear anybody to be made fun of
in her presence, even if it were the lowest, most insignificant
being. Maybe the sense of pride, which was one of her
tenderest and most touchy points, made her alive to the
wounds inflicted on that of others. Although she hated
Garnet, she was sorry to see him made an object of derision,
particularly as she was the cause; but this did not prevent
her treating him with overbearing airs herself; but it is
thought, and not without reason, that although the rebuffs
of the lady one loves may inflict misery, they do not sting
like practical jokes. The Indian, seeing himself so
honoured, was beside himself with delight, and set to
overwhelming her as usual with a thousand attentions.
Fernanda accepted them with a grave demeanour, but not
with repugnance. Then came as usual that game of "three
times yes, and three times no," the favourite of all present.
Thus Society amused itself with what had entertained its
fathers and grandfathers, and with what they thought would<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
amuse their children. Innocent people! There was one
spirit there to whom this attribute did not apply. Paco
played with the peevish condescension, of a man in advance
of his time, making many stupid mistakes, which showed
the inattention characteristic of superior beings. Nuñez, on
the contrary, was all there. Never was a man more at home
in such matters, nor one who entered into them more
thoroughly. His bright intelligence had penetrated all the
secrets of the game of forfeits, and he knew how to get the
best out of everybody according to the circumstances in
question. For example, when a young lady had to whisper
to him, he instantly became deaf, and the girl was obliged
to bend more and more until her ruddy lips brushed the
ear of the captain. If he were condemned to represent the
paper corner of the Puerta del Sol and consequently had to
have pieces of paper stuck on his face, &amp;c. &amp;c., the wily
Nuñez did not guess who it was doing it until he had passed
his hands over the girl.</p>

<p>But he gave the clearest demonstration of his portentous
talent and the vast knowledge he had acquired in this
department of science, when he proposed that the señorita,
to whom he would tell what she had in her pocket, would
have to kiss him. The young ladies were all so sure that
he would not be successful that they willingly accepted
the condition. He was certainly wrong in his attempt at
guessing the contents of the pocket of Carmelita, wrong
again with Fernanda, with Maria Josefa, with Micaela, but
see, what a sly rogue! he knew exactly what was in Emilita's:
some scissors, a handkerchief, a thimble, and three
caramels. The girl began to groan and clasp her hands in
a state of nervous collapse. "It was a trap! a trap!"
The captain serene, unperturbed, and dignified as some
hero of antiquity, refuted the imputation, and proved to
satiety that there was no question of a trap. "I do not
say," he added with a Mephistophelian smile, "but what<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>
it was an understood thing between us, as I was allowed to
see beforehand what her pocket contained."</p>

<p>The girl then became still more emphatic in her protestations
against this statement, and she became agitated to an
incomprehensible degree, and ran to the opposite end of
the room, as far as possible from the captain, as if he were
going to take by force what he had a right to. Those on
her side were the women, whilst the men took the part of
the captain. The drawing-room was then transformed into
a perfect pandemonium. They all talked, laughed, and
screamed without coming to any understanding. But, as is
easily supposed, the one who screamed and gesticulated the
most, was the girl concerned. Nevertheless, Don Cristobal,
seeing there were no signs of coming to an understanding
and wishing to countenance his daughter's course of action,
intervened in the dispute like a majestic god extending his
right hand to calm the waves of the stormy sea.</p>

<p>"Emilita," he said in a tone of command, "play is play;
give a kiss to this gentleman."</p>

<p>It is noticeable that he did not say to "the captain,"
nor "to this señor officer." His lips still revolted at using
a term exclusively military.</p>

<p>"But papa!" exclaimed the younger daughter, red as a
poppy.</p>

<p>"It must be done!" he returned, with his extended right
hand in the most commanding attitude that could be
assumed by such a godlike pensioner.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. Emilita, confused and ashamed,
with her cheeks like two fires, advanced with a hesitating
step to the brave captain of Pontevedra, who was sharp
enough to bring his lips to play upon the brilliant colouring
of her face.</p>

<p>But lo and behold! hardly was this effected than up
jumps a basilisk of a Micaela, who was indeed the most
irascible of the four nereids who inhabited the depths of the
dwelling of the Pensioner.<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></p>

<p>"How shameless! These are not decent games, but
low tricks. I am not astonished at Nuñez, for men are what
they are. But I am astonished at you, Emilita. It seems
to me that a little more modesty and shame would not
become you badly. But what is to be done, when those,
whose duty it is to inspire you with it are the first to abet
what is wrong?"</p>

<p>This heated diatribe against the author of her days turned
him pale and paralysed him. There was a moment of
embarrassed silence; then they were all eager to defend
Emilita, and maintain the purity and perfect innocence of
such games. The argument repeated most often was that
as there was no <i>malice prépense</i> it was of no account,
because the important thing in these matters was the
intention.</p>

<p>"Was the kiss given with intention?" asked one of the
most dialectical youths. "No? Then it was as if it had
not been given."</p>

<p>Nuñez assented gravely, being a little irritated, and eyeing
his future sister-in-law with some misgiving.</p>

<p>But she declined to surrender to such self-evident
demonstrations, and continued to request, each time more
violently and in a higher key, that her younger sister might
have a little shame, and her señor father a little feeling.
But as nobody appeared with these requisites in their hands,
to comply with these requests, there was nothing for it but
to go on lowering her diapason until her angry protestations
were gradually transformed into a far-away mutter like the
sounds of distant thunder, and the party returned to its
normal state of calm.</p>

<p>But the game of forfeits was over for that night. Nuncita,
who was generally the one for bright ideas, suggested that
they should play at <i>la boba</i> (the fool). I do not know why,
but this game had a particular attraction for the youngest of
the Señoritas de Meré. It is impossible to say what it was
that pleased the ex-fiancée of the Lieutenant Paniagua, when<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
she managed to get the fool on to any of her girl guests,
and what anxiety and concern she evinced when she had it
herself and could not get rid of it. Paco Gomez took the
pack of cards and took out the three knaves, then knowing
Nuncita's weakness, and wishing, according to his temperament,
to put her out a little, he made a sign to the others
that she had the knave, and all the guests soon became
a party to her keeping it. The result was that the "fool"
was nearly always in the hands of "the child," and try as
she would, no efforts could relieve her of it. This, in spite
of her natural gentleness, finally enraged her. The party
laughed, and so did she, but more with her lips than her heart.
At last, in a moment of anger, she dashed down the cards
and declared she would not play any more. Carmelita,
seeing such an act of discourtesy, intervened severely as
was her custom in any case of insubordination.</p>

<p>"What temper is this? Wherefore this madness? What
will these gentlemen think? They will say, and rightly,
that you have no education, and that our family has not
known how to bring you up. Now, take the cards at
once."</p>

<p>"I don't want to."</p>

<p>"What! what do you say, stupid? You&mdash;you are mad.
Was there ever such a wayward creature? Ta&mdash;take up
the cards at once."</p>

<p>Anger made her stutter so much that only incoherent
sounds proceeded from her toothless mouth.</p>

<p>"Hum!" muttered Nuncita as she twisted her lips into
a sulky pout.</p>

<p>"Child, don't enrage me!" cried her elder sister.</p>

<p>"I don't want to, I don't want to," repeated the obstinate
creature with decision.</p>

<p>And at the same time she dragged her reluctant feet into
the other room.</p>

<p>But her sister immediately followed with the severest and
most authoritative demeanour imaginable, prepared to<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
correct that beginning of rebellion which in time might
lead to most fatal consequences. A sound of dispute
was heard, the sharp angry voice of Carmelita was
raised, then it toned down, became more persuasive
and reasoning, until it regained its normal suavity,
as the echo of a sob reached the ears of the guests.
Finally, at the end of some time, Carmelita reappeared
with a slower step than her sister, with her eyes blazing
with authority, and the majestic attitude befitting those
who dictate laws to the beings Providence has confided
to their care. "The child" came behind ashamed
and submissive, with inflamed cheeks and tearful eyes.
She reseated herself at the table without daring to raise
her eyes to her elder sister, who still regarded her with
a certain severity, humbly took up the cards, and began
to play again. But instead of this touching example
of respect and submission making a grave impression
on the onlookers, it provoked a smile of amusement on
almost all their faces, and there emanated from some of them
inopportune bursts of laughter that were only repressed with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the game did not last long. The hour
approached for the select party to disperse.</p>

<p>"Maria Josefa, I saw your godchild at the promenade
to-day," said Paco Gomez, as he absently shuffled the cards.
"I gave it a kiss. She gets prettier every day. How old
is it now?"</p>

<p>"You can calculate. We had it baptised in February.
Two and a half months."</p>

<p>"Was it with its mother?" asked Manuel Antonio, smiling
in a peculiar way.</p>

<p>"No! I met the mother afterwards in Altavilla and
exchanged a remark with her," he gravely returned with
assumed naturalness.</p>

<p>The greater part of the guests looked at him with a smile,
and with an expression of reserved malice that surprised<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>
Fernanda. Only the two Señoritas de Meré and Garnet
remained unconcerned without taking any notice of the
conversation.</p>

<p>"But what godchild of yours are they talking about&mdash;of
the baby adopted by the Quiñones?" asked the heiress of
Estrada-Rosa of Maria Josefa.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, how are they speaking of its mother?"</p>

<p>"Because these two have an evil tongue. God keep us
from that!" returned the old maid, also smiling with malicious
pleasure, and at the same time looking at the young girl
with the pitiful kindness accorded to innocent creatures.</p>

<p>"But who do they suppose is its mother?"</p>

<p>"Who could it be?&mdash;Amalia!&mdash;Silence!" she added
hastily, lowering her voice.</p>

<p>Fernanda was stupefied. The news was so new and
surprising to her that she kept her eyes fixed on her friend
as if she had not heard. In the excitement of the moment
she had not heard the first words of Paco, but only thought
it was a question of his being warm in his praise of the
beauty of the child.</p>

<p>"It belongs to those it likens," murmured the Magpie
of Sierra, with the same intentional malignity. "Yes,
it is like its mother&mdash;and its father. Its father was a fine
boy."</p>

<p>Fernanda, a sudden prey to overwhelming curiosity,
insane curiosity that urged her on, agitated and breathless
without her knowing why, bent again towards Maria Josefa,
and putting her mouth to her ear, she asked in an agitated
voice:</p>

<p>"But who is its father?"</p>

<p>The old maid turned towards her, and fixed her eyes
upon her with an expression of surprise mingled with the
aforesaid indulgent compassion.</p>

<p>"But don't you really know?"</p>

<p>The girl made a sign in the negative, and at the same<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>
time she felt overwhelmed by terrible emotion. A cold
chill swept suddenly through her inner being. Pale as
death, she hung on the lips of Maria Josefa as if her sentence
of life or death depended on them. Her excitement was
quite evident to the lady, and after looking at her fixedly
for a minute she said:</p>

<p>"No! I won't tell you. What is the good? Perhaps it
is all a calumny."</p>

<p>Fernanda instantly regained her self-possession.</p>

<p>"All right!" she returned, with a gesture of displeasure;
"be silent, for after all what has all this to do with me?"</p>

<p>This gesture wounded the old maid, who quickly returned
with a malicious smile:</p>

<p>"But it is precisely because it does concern you that I am
afraid to tell you."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>Maria Josefa bent towards her and said:</p>

<p>"Because they say that the father of the creature is
Luis."</p>

<p>As she had anticipated the blow, Fernanda remained unmoved,
and asked her with indifference:</p>

<p>"What Luis?"</p>

<p>"The count, girl."</p>

<p>"And why should it concern me that Luis is the father?"</p>

<p>Maria Josefa was somewhat disconcerted at this question.</p>

<p>"Because he was your betrothed."</p>

<p>"But as he is not so now," she returned, with a scornful
shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>And then she begun talking to Garnet, who was on her
other side, but the indifference was only put on from pride.
An inexplicable penetrating sadness fell upon her soul, and
took complete possession of her without leaving her power
to think or do anything.</p>

<p>If Garnet had not been such a mere animal he would have
seen directly that the smile with which she listened to his
uncultured, rough conversation was only a stereotyped one<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
without any expression whatever, and that the monosyllables
and incoherent replies that fell from her lips showed very
clearly that she was not listening to him, but to Paco Gomez,
Manuel Antonio, and the others, as they went on chattering
about the foundling child.</p>

<p>With what interest did she catch every word that these
busybodies interchanged. And as they went on making
the fact clear with increasing details, intermixing joking
remarks and funny inuendos, there was a tightening at her
heart, and it gradually contracted as if they were all
compressing it in their hands one after the other to hurt her,
but her face remained calm, and not the slightest contraction
showed the pain she was suffering.</p>

<p>The party broke up at twelve as usual, and it was a great
comfort to Fernanda to breathe the cool, damp, night air.
She longed to be alone with her thoughts and think over
what she had just heard.</p>

<p>It had rained a good deal. The streets, paved with flat
stones, shone in the light of the lanterns. On leaving the
house some took the lower road, and others, amongst
whom was Fernanda, went off in the direction of the plaza.
They had only gone a few steps when they heard the loud
trotting of some horses that had that instant come round
the corner, and were bearing down upon them.</p>

<p>"Ah! here is the Baron and his servant," said Manuel
Antonio.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, the hour in which the eccentric Baron took
his habitual ride through the streets of Lancia. His famous
horse was pirouetting as usual, and making such a noise that
although his servant's steed was much more quiet, it seemed
as if a squadron were going through the town.</p>

<p>As they passed the party Manuel Antonio, with his usual
forwardness, cried out, "Good night, Baron." But he
only turned his awful face towards them, looked at them
fixedly with his blood-shot eyes, and then proceeded without
a remark.<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></p>

<p>The Chatterbox abashed said:</p>

<p>"Go on, drunk as usual!"</p>

<p>They all pretended to look upon it as a joke, but at the
bottom they all more or less felt the same alarm on seeing
that sinister figure. Fernanda, as a woman, and in her
particular state of mind, was visibly affected, and after they
had passed she followed the two horses with eyes of terror
until they were lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>On retiring to bed, with her wounded heart, she wished
to analyse the emotion which swayed her, and to trace it
back to the cause. She felt ashamed of herself. Her pride
made her cry out with rage in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"What have these bad goings on to do with me? What
have I to do with him or her?"</p>

<p>But hardly had she uttered these words than she felt the
scalding tears upon her cheeks, and the heiress of Estrada-Rosa
quickly turned and hid her face, suffused with blushes,
in the pillows.<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="head">THE INCREASE OF THE CONTINGENT</p>


<p class="nind">T<span class="smcap">he</span> terrible difficulties that were to arise with the marriage
of Emilita, on account of the anti-bellicose opinions of her
father, were got over with more facility than could have
been expected.</p>

<p>History will not speak (although it could with more
reason than it does of many events) of that solemn day
when Nuñez had to go in proper form and ask Don
Cristobal for the hand of his daughter, of the memorable
embrace with which the latter received him, clasping him
warmly to his civil breast with that incredible fusion of
two heterogeneous elements created to repel each other,
and the artless graces of the sweet coy angel are taken for
granted and understood. If this particular page were
the subject for any historian, he could not abstain from
drawing attention to the extreme importance of such concord,
which until then had been considered impossible,
and at the same time he would impartially show the
reverse side of the picture, laying before future generations
the way the maligned patrician, Don Cristobal Mateo, was
the victim of a social injustice, and of the persecution of
his brother citizens.</p>

<p>It must be said that all the world in Lancia thought
themselves entitled to joke this respectable and ancient
functionary on the marriage of his daughter, sometimes
directly, sometimes indirectly, but whenever the matter was
referred to, allusion was made to the antagonistic opinions<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>
he had hitherto held on the abolition of the land forces.
The marriage was called the increase of the contingent,
and some were impertinent enough to give it that name
before his future son-in-law.</p>

<p>One can easily conceive what it cost him to give up a
tiresome and ill-judged fad.</p>

<p>But in spite of all the diatribes and murmurs of the
neighbours, that hurt Mateo's feelings more than they
affected his good humour, and in spite of the envy that
burned in the majority of hearts, the increase of the contingent
was to be consummated.</p>

<p>The time fixed for the auspicious occasion was the
month of August. By that time it had acquired such importance
that, as generally happens in little places, hardly
anything else was talked of. The relations of the Pensioner,
and his four daughters were numberless, and they all expected
to be invited on the day of the marriage. And
then, on the other side, some of the worthy and punctilious
officers of the battalion of Pontevedra, friends of the bridegroom,
were filled with the same desire.</p>

<p>As it was not possible to entertain so many people in the
poetic dwelling of the Pensioner, they thought of celebrating
the marriage in the country. The house most fitting for
the occasion, by reason of its proximity to the town, was
the Grange.</p>

<p>Don Cristobal made the request to the count, with
whom he and his daughters were on very friendly terms,
and he immediately placed it at his disposal. The happy
union, the safe pledge of peace between the civil and
military elements, was celebrated early in the day at the
church of San Rafael. Fray Diego performed the ceremony,
as he enjoyed great prestige among the officers for
being the strangest priest and the most inveterate toper of
the capital. More than twenty ladies, and almost as many
gentlemen, assisted at the service. That over, they all
resorted to the Grange to spend the day there. Carriages<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>
were not required to go to a place so near the town. But
they had the Count of Onis and the Quiñones' to convey
the bride and bridegroom, and a few elderly people like
the two Señoritas de Meré. The guests included almost
all the Grandee's party, several of that of the de Merés, and
a good number of officers.</p>

<p>The count had the old house arranged as well as
possible. It was as well known to almost everybody as
their own homes, for being so near the town, and having
such a beautiful wood, it was the best place for <i>fêtes champêtres</i>,
and the counts had never refused permission for
these occasions. When they had arrived and enjoyed the
chocolate, which was waiting for them in the large room,
paved with brick on the ground floor, which served as
dining-room, they dispersed without ceremony over the
house and about the estate, prepared to kill the time as
well as they could until the bell rang for dinner.</p>

<p>The bride, with Amalia, who had been her bridesmaid,
and two other ladies sat quietly in one of the rooms. Her
eyes were shining, her cheeks red, and it was in vain that
she tried to conceal the deep emotion she was feeling
under a dignified and serious demeanour.</p>

<p>Those in her company, who were all married, caressed
her incessantly, passed their hands over her hair, gave her
little pats on the cheeks, and sometimes took her by the
hands and impressed a kiss on her forehead, with the half
tender, half ironical condescension evinced by the long
experienced to the novices in matrimony. There is not
one who does not feel at the sight of a bride the echo of
certain distant music in her heart, the taste of the honey of
the remote moon comes to her lips; but it comes, alas!
with the bitter taste of several years of matrimonial prose.
In every married woman there is a poet disillusioned of his
muse. Hence the Byronic smile on her face at the sight
of the happiness shining in the eyes of a bride.</p>

<p>Emilita had changed her character in a quarter of an<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>
hour. All the playfulness and sprightliness she had
hitherto displayed was now changed to gravity and
sedateness. She talked wisely with the matrons, her
companions, about starting the larder, about domestic
servants, who were considered by all to be dreadfully
going down, and the price of meat. She seemed
to have grown so old in this quarter of an hour that
it was surprising not to see some silver threads in
her golden hair. To turn to her sisters, they, in strange
contrast, seemed to have lost some years since the investiture
of the younger one. They had gone back to childhood.
Like creatures longing to disport themselves in the
light and air, the three rushed into the wood, making the
silence that reigned there ring with their voices and innocent
shouts of laughter. <i>Virgen del Amporo</i>! how they
jumped! how they laughed! What impish tricks those little
mad things were up to! For the greater enjoyment of the
innocent games that their youthful retrogression demanded,
they threw off their mantillas, let their hair loose, took off
their gloves, cast aside fan and parasol, did all that
youth could suggest, and were as pranksome as any children.
Not only was their angelic hair allowed to float
upon their shoulders, but they took off watches, rings, and
bracelets and handed them to papa, taking him by the
collar to give him a thousand caresses, like bright and
affectionate children as they were. Then, seeing that some
of the officers of the battalion were looking at them, they
turned red and confused, pinned up their skirts until the
foot and part of the leg was visible, and then ran through
the wood, avoiding, like the nymphs of Diana, the ardent
glances of the officers.</p>

<p>And when they reached a distant solitary spot, where
the shadows deepened, and they were beyond the reach of
mundane noises and malicious eyes of men, they shouted
with delight like God's little birds to their companions to
come and enjoy the delightful quiet where they could display<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>
their charms and enjoy themselves without fear of being
surprised. Then one proposed to play at skipping and the rest
acceded, clapping their hands. Jovita was the first. Jump,
jump, until she fell on the grass in a state of exhaustion,
pressing her hand to her heart that palpitated with fatigue,
not with the insane agitation of youthful passions. Then
another jumped, and then another, until they were all
exhausted but merry, their rosy cheeks and bright eyes
showing the pleasant happiness accruing to an innocent
mind. When tired of this they proposed the game of "Let
them give unto the kite a little onion with the mite."
What laughter and merriment ensued! How the quiet
wood echoed with the silvery voices of those beautiful,
delicate creatures! Wearied of this game they dispersed
for a little. A few formed a group seated at the foot of the
trunk of an oak, and went in for the pleasant enjoyment of
recounting in a low voice a thousand puerilities; others
went in with enthusiasm for the search of little blue flowers,
with which they made chains to deck themselves with;
others ran after each other like swallows in the air uttering
piercing screams the while. The steadier ones devoted
their efforts to catching grasshoppers and other timid insects.
But they soon reassembled, for a very daring girl proposed
climbing a tree if they helped her; and another one said
Yes, she would help her. So bear a hand! the spirited girl,
who was named Consuelo, set about putting her little feet
in the most accessible branches. The wayward companion,
who was no other than Socorro, the third of the Pensioner's
sirens, helped her. Consuelo finally climbed to where two
branches crossed, from thence she got on to another,
and all the nymphs applauded, and shouted with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But lo and behold! Rubio, the lieutenant of the Third, a
man known among his companions in arms as a genius in
the art of enslaving the opposite sex, suddenly raised his
bold head above the bushes. The nymphs, on seeing him,<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>
uttered a piercing cry, and stood petrified in the act in
which he had surprised them. Consuelo, from the top of
the tree, apostrophised him violently. If it had been in her
power she would have immediately transformed that new
Actæon into a stag. But there, <i>entre nous</i>, it is possible that
she would have preferred first to transform him into a husband,
regardless of a more exact rendering of the classical
metamorphosis.</p>

<p>But Rubio, the lieutenant of the Third, knew perfectly
well what these shrieks and apostrophisings were worth.
He was not put out, he smiled maliciously, and called with
a rough voice to his brothers in arms. What confusion!
What terror among those merry daughters of the
wood as the sons of Mars approached in a closed line!
Without picking up their mantillas, gloves or parasols,
nothing, in short, that belonged to them, they fled through
the plantation uttering cries of terror. But the satyrs in red
trousers willingly followed them, caught them up, and took
them captive with hateful laughter. In the meanwhile poor
Consuelo, besieged by three of these bold satyrs, simply
declined to come down until they went fifty yards off. But
they, the cruel creatures, they refused. The nymph
entreated, got angry, and was on the point of crying, but
neither her anger nor her tears could soften the stony hearts
of the infamous satyrs. At last she resigned herself to
coming down, and although she took many modest precautions,
they managed to see a foot charmingly shod, and a
suspicion of leg, which made them roar with delight.
But where was Rubio? Where was the most terrible and
fiercest of all? They did not know, but at the end of some
time he appeared from the glade, bringing with him
Socorro, the most sentimental of Don Cristobal's undines.
His cruel features bore an expression of triumph, and hers
evinced the shame and submission of a captive. Many
hours later, near midnight, seated at a table of the Café
Marañón, and surrounded by eight or ten of his companions,<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>
the lieutenant of the Third related with a malevolent smile
his conquest of the nymph, calculating that he had
managed to imprint at least twenty-five or thirty kisses on
different parts of her bewitching face, and all the sons
of Mars applauded and celebrated this fresh triumph
of their heroic companion with Homeric shouts of
laughter.</p>

<p>Finally the conquerors modified their tyranny, and order
was re-established, thanks to the opportune arrival of the
Señoritas de Meré, who appeared with Maria Josefa and
Paco Gomez. The little ladies, the only ones, in fact, to
whom the matrimonial event was due, had turned over their
boxes for a befitting toilette for the occasion, and Carmelita
wore a dress of black bombazin, which only came out on
state occasions, whilst Nuncita, being younger and less
sedate, was able to wear a clear dress bordered with flowers,
such as are only seen in pictures of the past century. They
were very cheerful, satisfaction shone in their eyes, but their
legs were not equal to the eternal youth of their hearts;
they supported themselves on sticks, and leant with their
free hands on the arms of their companions. They were
received with cheers and hurrahs. Many rude jokes
were levelled at them, to which nobody assented more
willingly nor laughed more heartily than the little saints of
Meré, so there was little merit in quizzing them. They were
never seen to be cross with their friends, and so fun was
pushed so far with them that it sometimes bordered on
coarseness; but they were very prone to intestine warfare,
and to get cross with each other; however, we know the
leading feature of these performances.</p>

<p>The bold spirit of Lieutenant Rubio, sharpened, by the
circumstances, conceived a most happy idea; he thought
the best way of passing the time until the dinner-hour
would be to construct a swing in which the ladies could be
pulled backwards and forwards for some minutes by the
gentlemen, who would have the pleasure of managing the<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
apparatus. No sooner said than done. Ropes were found,
a board was cut, in less than a quarter of an hour everything
was in order. Whilst the arrangements were being completed,
Rubio kept on giving expressive winks to his
companions, who understood, smiled, held their tongues,
and greatly admired the audacity and penetration of the
lieutenant of the Third. The swing was now fixed. Who is
to be the first? They all evinced the same shame, and the
same colour suffused their cheeks. One mischievously
thought of suggesting Nuncita. The rest applauded the idea.
Nuncita held back in dismay. Carmelita neither conceded,
nor withheld her permission. The entreaties were repeated
on all sides.</p>

<p>The young men seemed each minute to be more taken
with the idea. At last, almost by force, and amid the
frantic applause of the party, Cuervo, the herculean cornet
of the First, took the "child" up in his arms and seated
her on the board.</p>

<p>"Hold tight, Nuncia!" cried Paco Gomez, whilst the
aforesaid cornet and some other friends began to swing her.</p>

<p>"Gently! gently!" exclaimed Carmelita.</p>

<p>No fear; they were careful because they were afraid she
would fall. But, carefully as they moved the swing, the air
gradually began gently to raise her skirts. The officers
laughed and went on with the swing until there was quite
an exhibition.</p>

<p>"Go it! go it!"</p>

<p>The girls, with mingled amusement and shame, hid their
faces, fell into each other's arms, and whispered into each
other's ears.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop, gentlemen!" cried Carmelita.</p>

<p>Nobody took any notice. The "child's" clothes went
higher and higher. One did not know where they would stop.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! por Dios, señor cadet!"</p>

<p>"Go it with her!" cried the soldiers.</p>

<p>And the swing went quicker and quicker, and Nun<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>cita
was so frightened that she had no time to think of
modesty.</p>

<p>"Señor cadet! señor captain!" cried Carmelita all
trembling, waving her arms, with her lower jaw distended,
beating against the upper one, which was also distended,
with a strange trembling. "Señor captain, stop, por Dios!
For the love of the Holy Virgin! Stop! stop! stop!"</p>

<p>"So-o-o!" exclaimed Paco.</p>

<p>But the captain was obdurate and would not leave off.
The skirts of Nuncita were now as high as they could go.
The young girls turned their backs, and some ran laughing
to hide themselves among the trees. It was only when the
officers had completed their shameless act that they gave in
and allowed Nuncita to get down. Her sister, instead of
being angry with the guilty ones, flew upon "the child" full
of fury, with her eyes flaming with rage.</p>

<p>"Get down, you bad girl! you shameless creature! Is
this the education you learnt from your parents? Is this
what the confessor tells you to do?"</p>

<p>Nuncita, quite upset, puckered up her face and began to
cry.</p>

<p>The young men and women tried to calm the infuriated
Carmelita. The captain and the cadet took all the blame.
It was in vain. The anger was not appeased until it had
vented itself in many violent and offensive remarks. The
poor "child," seated sobbing on the ground with her face
hid in her hands, excited the compassion of all present,
who interceded for her incessantly.</p>

<p>It was then a question as to who was to get up into the
swing next? Nobody wished to, which was very natural.
How could one be swung by such bold, shameless men?
It was in vain that soldiers and civilians explained their
conduct in the past event, and solemnly swore not to do it
again, but to be orderly and prudent and always under the
ladies' orders. But they were not to be trusted. The
lieutenant Rubio especially inspired them with a great<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>
terror as they considered him, and not without reason, as
the instigator of all the shameless tricks.</p>

<p>But when they were quite at their wits' end, lo! and behold
Consuelo, the brave, determined child, who shortly before
had climbed the tree, whispered to one of her companions,
came forward and said, to the horror of the other girls:</p>

<p>"I will do it. Help me, gentlemen."</p>

<p>A cry of enthusiasm greeted these spirited words. For
some instants nothing was heard but "Viva Consuelo! viva
Consuelo!" from the delighted company. There was not
one that did not wish to help her and load her with flowers
and presents. The athletic cadet, with a knightly air,
knelt on one knee and asked her to place her foot on the
other. The intrepid girl, nothing loth, consented, and with
one spring she was on the seat. Both soldiers and civilians
thought they were in luck's way. They exchanged looks
of intelligence, they had no intention of keeping their word,
and they were determined to repay the girl's confidence
with the blackest treason. But when they were getting the
apparatus ready and preparing to execute their malicious
design, Consuela made a sign to her friend, who immediately
came forward with a handful of pins and fastened her skirts
together in such a way that even when the swing moved the
point of her foot could not be seen.</p>

<p>The weaker sex applauded with mad enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Good, Consuelo! good!"</p>

<p>The men, vexed and defeated as they were, dared not
protest too much, but they complained of her want of confidence,
whilst the maiden herself, proud of the feat, looked
at them with a smile of derision. The pins were such a
success that no girl got up into the swing without prudently
having her skirts pinned together.</p>

<p>Whilst such memorable scenes were being enacted in the
wood Jaime Moro, scorning rural pleasures, tried to get
Fray Diego and Don Juan Estrada-Rosa to make up a
party for a game of <i>tresillo</i>.<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></p>

<p>He was bored in church, he was bored in the woods, in
the town, and in the country. He only recovered his
serenity of mind, and regained his equanimity and cheerfulness
of spirits, when he took the cards into his hand. Fate
was against him. There were no cards in the house. But
he did not give in. He went down into the kitchen, called
a servant aside who looked sharp and active, and giving
him a <i>pourboire</i>, he told him to run to the town and get a
couple of packets of cards. In the meanwhile he was
strenuous in his efforts to entertain his companions, chatting
away on subjects most interesting to them, and, above all,
trying to conciliate Don Juan, who showed a decided tendency
to go off and take a turn in the grounds and pay
a visit to the mill like the other guests. Moro was at his
wits' end, fearing he would not hold out till the servant's
return, but happily he arrived in time. Directly he
held in his hands the much-desired cards he was another
man. Secure now of victory, he dragged off his friends to
one of the quiet rooms of the house, had a square table
brought, candles, beer, cigars, and there they were!</p>

<p>After such a narrow shave of losing it, Jaime Moro
enjoyed his pleasure with a gusto that was enviable. A
large number of shallower people, without sufficient imagination
to understand or enjoy the delights of <i>tresillo</i>, had
gone off, with the Pensioner as their guide, to take a turn
round the place, and afterwards to visit the new-fashioned
mill which the count had had erected a short time ago.</p>

<p>Captain Nuñez, the bridegroom, with a few of his friends
who were less partial to the feminine sex, such as Garnet,
Don Enrique, Saleta, Manin, and a few others, were of the
party. They could not get the count to go because he
was not to be found. It was said he was giving orders to
the men and surveying some works a little way off, but he
was not anywhere about. However, a capable sort of half
majordomo volunteered to act as guide.</p>

<p>The property was situated on the decline of the same<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
hill as that on which Lancia is built. At the back of the
house there was a wood that shut out the view of the town,
so that although it was so near it seemed as if it were a
hundred miles away; at the same time it protected it
against the north and west winds, only leaving it exposed to
the gentle breezes from the south and east. The noises of
the town did not penetrate as far as there; only the bells of
the cathedral muffled by the distance sounded sweetly at
certain hours of the day. The high road goes behind the
wood. Another little one branching from it brought it into
communication with the estate. As we know, there was no
park <i>à l'Anglais</i> here, or <i>au Français</i>, no little gardens, or
cascades, or artificial grottoes. It was a property half for
amusement, half for work. First came the wood, then the
house with its courtyard, then a large deserted garden, and
then immense meadows extending along the skirt of the hill
as far as the river and even to the opposite bank. Sheep
graze in these meadows, and the tinkling of their bells with
the barking of the dogs are heard. It is easy to imagine that
you are in the bosom of solitary nature, so profound is the
peace, only broken by the song of a bird or the moo of a cow.</p>

<p>The excursionists went through the stables that were in
good order, for the count was much interested in the cattle.
Nevertheless, Saleta affirmed that he had seen much better
in Holland, and one or two coarse incidents were here
given to show the care of the Dutch in this respect. When
they had been over the stables, they took the road across
the fields and went down to the river, adorned on either
side with alder trees and poplars, which formed at intervals
a thick coppice, under which the river made its dark and
gloomy way. The Loro is one of the smallest, and yet one
of the most original rivers in Spain. Before arriving at the
sea, "to die" as the poet says, it makes as many twists and
turns as any crafty old fellow, who tries to evade the law to
which all created beings are subject. It is impossible to
imagine a more capricious stream. It sallies forth, brave<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
and buoyant, as if it were going on for miles straight away
to the ocean. But after a quarter of a mile it stops, turns,
and meanders back nearly to where it started from, which
gives some cause for thinking that it is going to take a
higher course. It then starts afresh, not willingly, but by
force of circumstances; this time it is lost to view, and
everybody thinks it will never reappear, but it is not so.
When the sly fox knows that he cannot be seen from the
town, he sets about returning to it, but for shame's sake he
makes a little détour, and stays a short while at some
village near the same district. It never takes a frank and
open course. Like all depraved characters it abhors the
light, and takes every opportunity of avoiding trouble, by
hiding under bushes, where it stops and grows corrupt in
degrading idleness. Nobody can trust it. Many fine
young men have been deceived by it seeming like an old
rheumatic invalid, incapable of taking a step, and following
its invitation to bathe where they were made to think it was
only about a foot and a half deep, they were miserably
drowned in its slimy depths.</p>

<p>In this river there were no naiads of celestial beauty ready
to cleave the crystal waters with their alabaster arms, and
no gracious undines with fair hair to come forth at night
and play upon the surface.</p>

<p>The river Loro is gloomy, inimical to all poetic fancy,
no fantastic figures hover there. The only thing it seems
to take pleasure in harbouring is a vast quantity of frogs, so
large that it makes one giddy to think that a number of
them can live together, and the banks resound with the
cheerful sound of their harmonious voices, which thundering
sound prevented Saleta declaring, as he did when a
little distance off, that when on the banks of the Yumuri on
a certain evening, he was lucky enough to kill a crocodile
with a stone. 'Tis true that under the piercing glance of
his colleague Valero, he hastily added that the crocodile
was quite young and only had one row of teeth.<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>

<p>They went for some distance along the gloomy bank of
the Loro and crossed it by a rustic bridge, where the count
had had it turned from its course by means of an aqueduct
to work a mill. But just then a sudden desire seized the
friends of the bridegroom, who were genuine representatives
of the most vigorous and masculine element of the
battalion, to show off the strength and muscular power of
their legs. A lieutenant jumped the aqueduct. A captain,
to be in no way behind the subaltern, did the same, but he
got his feet wet. His <i>amour propre</i> being excited, he took
off his coat and jumped it again easily. The others did the
same. The scene then assumed the appearance of the
Olympian games, or still more those of the famous
American display. But Nuñez was a great jumper. He
was well known in all the army, especially in the infantry,
as an adept in this art. He jumped three or four times
with the greatest ease; but naturally wishing to surpass his
companions, and give a striking proof of his skill, he
affirmed in a scornful tone that that was nothing, and that
he was capable of jumping the aqueduct backwards. These
words were received with respect by his colleagues, but
also with a silence which the captain took for sceptical.
He did not divest himself of a particle of his uniform, such
courses were only for neophytes, but took a leap, and
arriving at the edge of the water, turned and jumped, but
unfortunately his feet were caught in some rushes and he fell
flat into the stream. He was hidden for a moment from
the sight of his friends, and came up puffing and blowing
like a regular triton, saying that it was nothing, and that he
was going to jump again to show them how it could be
done. But his father-in-law would not allow it. He
passed his hands over his body to see if he were wet, as of
course he was, and then a prey to the wildest agitation, he,
who a short while since would have exterminated the whole
army completely, set to bawling:</p>

<p>"He must change his things! Now, at once!&mdash;Inflam<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>mation
of the lungs!&mdash;Change his things!&mdash;Shivers!&mdash;Rheumatic
fever!"</p>

<p>And other exclamations more or less coherent that gave
proof of his profound interest in the officer's health.</p>

<p>In spite of his martial calling, Nuñez acceded to the
entreaties, and turned back to the house with his face
frowning and furious, fully resolved to undress as far as his
underthings, and go to bed whilst they sent to Lancia for
a change of clothes. All his friends crowded round him,
and so they arrived at the house.</p>

<p>Emilita, who was at the window, seeing them come along
like this, asked in surprise:</p>

<p>"What is this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," cried Papa, "but Nuñez fell into the aqueduct."</p>

<p>On hearing these words, Emilita naturally uttered a
shriek of horror, and fell senseless into the arms of several
ladies. Nuñez, transformed into a hero, forgetting his own
health, ran to her assistance. In a few moments the place
was filled with glasses of water, and two or three bottles of
anti-spasmodic appeared upon the scene. When she began
to recover consciousness and the critical moment of tears
arrived, her sister Micaela, no longer able to control herself,
attacked her father violently:</p>

<p>"This has been an act of cruelty! Do you think your
daughter has a heart of bronze? You must indeed be
deficient in tact to hurt a poor creature like this!"</p>

<p>The poor creature repaid the defence with an affectionate
look as she gave her her hand. The Pensioner, being then
reduced to the last stage of humility, scarcely dared to
murmur, that seeing that Nuñez was at her side, there was
no cause for so much concern.</p>

<p>The ladies thought that Micaela had been disrespectful
to her father, but they could not do less than admit that it
had been a blunder, and they were full of sympathy for the
unhappy bride.<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="head">FERNANDA AND THE WINE</p>


<p class="nind">F<span class="smcap">ernanda</span> was not present at any of these scenes. Early
in the day she had resorted to the wood, but soon tiring of
playing the part of modest nymph with her friends, she
wandered off to more solitary places. Her head, generally
so erect, was bowed under the weight of depression or
preoccupation; her flexible, supple figure moved from side
to side like the body of a bedouin; those dark African eyes,
the most precious ornament of the noble city of Lancia,
were fixed upon the ground, and the very deep line on her
forehead testified to the fixed, gloomy drift of her thoughts.</p>

<p>How much she had gone through these two months!
The impression that her love for the count had made in
her heart, checked at first by pride and the hope of having
it returned, had full sway directly she discovered the secret
of his disaffection, and her whole being became possessed
with the passions of love and jealousy. These feelings
were all the more acute, inasmuch as she clearly saw that
she had long been deceived by Luis, who had feigned
affection for her whilst his heart was given to another.</p>

<p>The miserable treachery of Amalia enraged her and
inspired her with horror and exasperation. But that of the
count, it must be confessed, added poignancy to her grief
and depth to her passion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she knew how to maintain the same friendly
relations; but in spite of herself, and without her even
being conscious of it, a slight shade of bitterness and scorn<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>
betrayed itself at times either in her manner, eyes, or tone,
which did not escape the attention of the sharp Valencian.</p>

<p>With her <i>ex-fiancé</i> she retained a circumspect demeanour;
she dropped the aggressive tone she had taken with
him, and adopted a more suave and formal manner, but to
her vexation, the emotion she experienced when speaking to
him was not unfrequently revealed by a slight alteration in
her voice, and by her turning alternately red and white.
Her inner life during those six months was devoured by a
feverish, anxious, uncertain activity, veiled with difficulty
under a tranquil, proud demeanour. At times she could
not bear the tension of the dumb rage which possessed her,
and it vented itself in a torrent of burning, insulting words,
which were uttered in a low voice, when she surprised any
sign of intelligence between the traitors. Her ardent,
proud nature, flattered by a father who indulged her to a
fault, and by a score of adorers prostrate at her feet,
rebelled like a wild colt against this obstacle, the first she
had ever encountered in her life.</p>

<p>In these moments of frenzy she fostered ideas of revenge.
She wrote several anonymous letters to Don Pedro, but
none arrived at their destination, for she tore them up
before posting them, because the pride, that was one of her
characteristics, revolted against such a low proceeding; and
they were destroyed with bitter tears of anger. After
tearing up the last that she wrote she had reason to be glad
of her course of action, for she casually learnt that very
evening, that no letter reached Quiñones without first
passing through the hands of his wife.</p>

<p>Sometimes, unable to bear it any longer, she would throw
herself into an armchair where she remained for a long time
with her eyes fixed, in deep and miserable meditation. At
these moments she was a prey to sudden fits of tenderness,
she confessed without shame, nay even with voluptuous
enjoyment, the love that she felt; she pardoned Luis with
all her heart, and vowed to love him all her life long in<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>
silence and never to belong to another man. As days went
by this feeling increased and took the form of a morbid,
irrational desire. The excitement of her feelings, which
took possession of her whole being, combined with the
bitterness of wounded self-love, fostered this same desire.
There was little wanting when she saw Luis at her side to
make her open her heart to him and confess the passion that
consumed her.</p>

<p>Hardly conscious of what she was doing, Fernanda
sought for her <i>ex-fiancé</i> all over the place. Everything
interested her; the wood, the house, the servants, even the
animals grazing in the meadows were accorded a sympathetic
glance. How pleasant even that tumble-down
house corroded with damp and mice seemed to her! After
wandering for some time through the most solitary parts of
the wood, she absently made her way to the meadows;
there she went along until she came to a certain spot where
there were some workmen making a ditch to drain the land.
She knew without inquiring that the count after inspecting
the work for some time had gone off. She waited for a
little while to divert attention, and then she went on with a
slow step dragging her parasol along the ground like one
who is uncertain where to go next. In fact she did not
know, but that was not for want of an object, but because
she knew not where the count was. A cruel idea floated in
her brain without taking form&mdash;she fancied that Luis at that
moment might be alone with Amalia. By degrees, as she
walked through the fields, the idea gained force, and the
stronger it grew, the more her heart was filled with spite
and anger. Why? was she not perfectly aware of their
criminal relations? Yes, and the more angry the idea
made her, the more determined she was not to stand it, for
she thought she had a right to prevent their being together.
Without having a clear notion of what she was about, she
quickened her step. Her nerves became more and more
agitated; by the time she arrived at the courtyard she was<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
perfectly certain that the adulterers were together, and
alone. She entered the house, and like one who visits it
from curiosity she explored it all, even to the most remote
little rooms. But she did not find them, and the fact of
not finding Amalia anywhere confirmed her suspicions.
Tired with hunting about, and excited with nervous anxiety,
she went again into the open air. She avoided people who
might detain her and repaired to the garden, and directly
she put her foot there she was imbued with fresh hope of
finding them. That verdant spot where the little trees left
to their own sweet will, were so interlaced as to form an
impenetrable mass was a perfect place for love passages.
She went cautiously and noiselessly along the paths which
had almost disappeared under their carpets of grass, intersected
in many places by brambles and branches of trees.
Sometimes a little clump of irises obstructed her path and
she was obliged to jump over it, or else a rhododendron,
stretching its boughs to embrace a camellia in front, had
formed a bower so low that she was obliged to bend a good
deal to get along. She thought she heard the sound of
voices a little distance off. She stood motionless and
waited for some minutes, and then she turned to listen, and
directed her steps to the spot whence it came.</p>

<p>It was them! Yes, it was them.</p>

<p>Before hearing the voice distinctly she knew it was them.
They were going down a path much narrower and more
secluded than the others, bounded on one side by the wall,
and on the other by a high, quickset hedge.</p>

<p>Amalia had hold of the count's arm with an air that was
half imperious, half careless, with her eyes on the ground,
whilst he, smiling and subservient, bent towards her as he
whispered words into her ear. Fernanda watched them
through the foliage from a distance. Emotion glued her to
the ground for some instants. The awakening of her pride
as a woman seemed to outweigh her sense of misery and
anger.<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></p>

<p>After an anxious scrutiny of Amalia's appearance, she could
not forbear murmuring:</p>

<p>"What can this man have fallen in love with? Yes, she
is a skinny cat!"</p>

<p>Her next thought was:</p>

<p>"What are they saying?"</p>

<p>Seized with a strong desire to hear their words, and without
thinking of the danger that she ran, she went nearer
and nearer to the hedge, bending her body so as not to be
seen. Having found the shadiest, safest spot, she listened,
although she could only hear them as they passed by, as
soon as they were a little way off not a word was audible,
so the snatches of conversation were rather incoherent.</p>

<p>"Her legs are very rough. You should see how fat she
is getting. Neither starch nor rose powder soothes the irritation
of the skin," said the lady.</p>

<p>"They are talking of the baby," thought Fernanda.</p>

<p>"I have never seen her in her bath. How much I would
give to be present one day!"</p>

<p>"It is because you do not want to."</p>

<p>"No, no, but I do not want to expose you to the danger
that would accrue from my doing so."</p>

<p>No more could be heard, but she felt she must wait for
them to get to the end of the path and then turn.</p>

<p>"So I hear you were at those childish, silly old ladies,"
she heard Amalia say as they repassed her hiding-place.</p>

<p>"I assure you I was at the Casino. All the members of
the club met to discuss the question of the re-decoration of
the <i>salon</i>. It was to be over at ten, and we did not get away
until twelve. You know the argumentative, aggressive character
of Don Juan, don't you? I have not been to the de
Merés for an age. Since some people set to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were here lost again to Fernanda.</p>

<p>That Don Juan must be her father? She would soon
find out.</p>

<p>When they reappeared the count was tenderly caressing<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>
the hand of his beloved, and smiling and chatting with an
expression of rapturous happiness.</p>

<p>"I have often thought of giving up seeing you. At
night when I am alone in bed, I am a prey to terrible
remorse, and I say to myself, 'There must be an end of
this,' and I determine to leave Lancia, and I map out a
new plan of life: I imagine myself travelling over all
Europe; I forget you; I return at the end of some years,
and instead of the old love a tender friendship fills my
heart in which we can indulge without fear of Heaven's
chastisement. But as the morning dawns, these resolutions
vanish; I succumb to temptation; I see you at your house,
and the more I see you, the more I hear your adored
voice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fernanda clutched at the trunk of a magnolia for
support.</p>

<p>As they turned, it was Amalia who was speaking:</p>

<p>"This is not true. I have told you that I am always
haunted by a black shadow. However much I pretend to
imagine that I am the first&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The first and the last! I shall never love another
woman but you."</p>

<p>"You don't know how jealous I am of the past. Every
day more so. Tell the truth. Did you love her or
not?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then how could you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Fernanda could hear no more, but she had heard enough
to make the tears rush to her eyes. She was about to
withdraw, when she saw the traitors come to a standstill at
the end of the path.</p>

<p>Amalia threw her arms around her lover's neck, pressed
her lips upon his mouth, and gave him a kiss that was
prolonged, prolonged for an eternity. Fernanda closed her
eyes; when she opened them they were going away hand in
hand.<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></p>

<p>She lets them leave the garden, and then follows them
immediately. Where are they going? Once in the courtyard,
she notices that they stop and turn in the direction of
the house. She enters on their track, but they have
disappeared, and she does not know to which room they
have repaired. She imprudently explores them all, overwhelmed
with emotion she cannot control, whilst given
over to a strong burning desire to find them out.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Fernanda?" asks a young man.</p>

<p>"I am going to find the bride."</p>

<p>"Then you are going wrong, for she is at the other end
of the house in one of the rooms looking north."</p>

<p>She turned back to avoid suspicion, and then explored
the building again. At last she arrived at a certain little
room which was locked, and which was no other than the
celebrated Countess's Chamber. She was about to turn the
handle of the door as she had done to the others when a
slight sound rooted her to the spot. She put her ear to
the door. "It is them!"</p>

<p>She left the place and ran like mad to the wood, where,
arrived at a solitary spot, she sits at the foot of a tree and
leans her head against the trunk. With her eyes fixed on
space, her face changed and sad, and her hands crossed
upon her knee, her whole attitude was expressive of dumb,
despairing agony.</p>

<p>The hour for dinner arrived. Two parallel tables had
been arranged in the large <i>salon</i> on the ground floor.</p>

<p>The dispersed party reassembled at the magic word of
dinner shouted to the four winds by the rough voice of
Manin and the silvery one of Manuel Antonio.</p>

<p>When poetic sentiments have their course in the open air
in the middle of woods they greatly facilitate the secretion
of the gastric juices. So the nymphs as well as the fauns
did full justice to the olives, the cucumbers, and the slices
of sausage before sitting down to the tables. By the
unanimous voice of the military and clergy, worthily repre<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>sented
by Fray Diego, the task of giving each guest his seat
was to be undertaken by the bride.</p>

<p>The merry, wayward Emilita, transformed suddenly into a
very grave matron, filled the office with a tact and amiability
that won her the approbation of the assembly; every
girl was given the youth she liked best as a partner, and to
every older person, was accorded the companion who was
most congenial in character and tastes.</p>

<p>But mad was the applause when she put Lieutenant
Rubio between the two Señoritas de Meré. She left this
facetious act to the last, which cleverness saved the officer
from thinking it was intentional.</p>

<p>Finding himself the victim of such a trick the military
man was put out, and was even on the point of protesting
against this arrangement of Emilita, but he controlled
himself against this outrage of all the laws of gallantry; and
as he was taking his place it occurred to him to parody the
words of Napoleon as he looked at his two neighbours:
"From the height of these two seats forty centuries contemplate
me."</p>

<p>This remark won the applause of the company, and put
the injured creature into a good humour, and he got on so
well with his little old friends that he was that evening
voted a capital sort of fellow.</p>

<p>Moro was seated by the side of the count, and during
the dinner he impressed on him the advantage of having a
billiard-table in the palace of the Grange. He knew every
make, but the best was indisputably that of Tutau of
Barcelona, and he praised up the article as if he were a
traveller for the house. Luis' face showed his disappointment
and vexation at not being by Amalia, but Emilita
neither dared to put him there, nor by Fernanda. The
first would have been a scandal, the second a vexation to
both.</p>

<p>They feasted like at a banquet in the "Iliad." But the
Achilles of this extensive repast was Manin, the rough<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
Manin who, according to those that were next to him,
consumed no less than eleven calabashes of wine. Certainly
Manin deserved being called, if not a Sueve, as that would
offend Saleta, at least a Lombard. He talked and halloed
as if he were in the street.</p>

<p>The three Fates of the Pensioner, who from the time Fray
Diego gave his blessing to their sister, had gained so much
childish grace, threw pellets of bread at the officers, who
cast glances at the bride, and winked at their friend Nuñez,
as they murmured remarks which sent them off into fits of
laughter.</p>

<p>Paco Gomez was having a battle royal with Maria Josefa.
It was difficult to say which of the two had the worst of it,
and which launched the sharpest, most envenomed darts.
Saleta being some way off from his friend and censor, Don
Enrique Valero, was enjoying himself to his heart's content,
relating to Don Juan Estrada-Rosa and two other gentlemen
how he made the conquest of a certain English lady, wife
of a consul he had known at Hong-Kong, on his way out
to the Philippines. The ship only stopped there twenty-four
hours. In this short time he won her heart and made
her go off with him. But he had to separate from her at
once, for the event was made the subject of a diplomatic
reclamation on the part of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Manuel Antonio being suddenly seized with a great
interest in a scarlet subaltern by his side overwhelmed him
with delicate attentions.</p>

<p>"Federico&mdash;a little olive&mdash;don't take so much mustard,
it will spoil it. Keep yourself for the partridges. I know
they are most excellent. Do you like Bordeaux? Stop a
moment, I will get you some."</p>

<p>And rising from the table in his eagerness to serve, he
fetched a couple of bottles and placed them before the
youth.</p>

<p>"So Lancia seems to agree with you. When you came
six months ago you looked thin and pale. I said, 'What a<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
sad sight, and a young man so bright and pleasant.' Because
I thought you were suffering from the chest. I know you
had a hard time of it in Barcelona. Eh? and see now,
whoever would have thought it? I recollect that when you
arrived you wore a gabardine of the colour of flies' wings,
very well made, and a scarf of a very pretty sky blue. I
recollect that the civil costume suited you very well,
but I like you better in uniform. It may be fancy, but I
can't help it. I say that with the uniform and with the
moustache you are, to my mind, just perfect."</p>

<p>Sundry significant coughs from the officers facing them
paralysed him suddenly. But it did not affect him long,
for he was incapable of being put to shame by anybody.</p>

<p>The one who was the most put out and cross was the
ensign himself.</p>

<p>As the banquet drew to its close some of the gentlemen,
favoured by the Muses, rose to propose toasts in verse or
something approaching it. And those who had not a poetic
vein congratulated the bridal pair in prose, but the result in
either case was the same&mdash;to wish the bride and bridegroom
an eternal honeymoon; and the periodical which announced
the marriage the following day, also expressed the same
wish. The toast of the father of the bride was the most
original and interesting of all. Was it not strange to hear
the bitter enemy of the armed force sing its praises, and
declare himself a sworn partisan of the increase of the
contingent, and the pay of the officers? He was so moved
at his own words that the tears coursed down his cheeks.
Of course some said he wept the wine he had drunk, but
we are far from believing this malevolent insinuation, first,
because it is absurd to talk of weeping wine, and secondly,
because his tone was so sincere and his manner so pathetic
that nobody could doubt that his words came from the
bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>"It is a comfort," he said&mdash;"yes, it is a comfort that God
has let me see my daughter marry an honourable soldier&mdash;<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>for
to speak of a soldier in Spain is to speak of honour.
To keep up the army, to honour the army, is to keep up
and honour the honour of the nation. To keep up the
army is to keep up the power and prosperity of the country.
To keep up the army is to keep up our prestige with the
greatest nations of Europe. To keep up the army is to
live respected by the world. To keep up the army is to
keep up ourselves. To keep up the army&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the army be kept up, but let Don Cristobal sit
down," called out somebody.</p>

<p>The Pensioner held his position, cast a look of sad reproach
to the place whence the voice had come, raised his
pocket handkerchief to his eyes to dry his tears, calmly
drank the wine that remained in his glass, and gravely took
his seat amid the applause and laughter of the company.</p>

<p>Fernanda did not open her lips during the dinner. All
the efforts of Garnet, who, through the kindness of Emilita
had been placed near to his much-desired lady love, were
without effect. Neither by talking of saffron and describing
how tobacco is gathered, making exact calculations on each
load of sugar, and what would be the profit if duty were
lowered, nor going over the hundred and one interesting
details of the importation of salted meats from the Argentine
Republic and the codfish from Newfoundland, could Romeo
extract more than dry monosyllables from his Juliet. All
she did was to hand him her glass from time to time, and
say in an imperious tone: "Some more wine."</p>

<p>The Indian quickly complied with the request, and the
young lady emptied the glass at one gulp, put it on the
table, then cast her contemptuous eyes over the guests, and
fixed them persistently upon Amalia. By degrees those
eyes became heavier, the eyelids drooped, they became
inflamed and turned from one side to the other with more
difficulty.</p>

<p>Don Santos, who was astonished at this manner of drinking,
ventured to say:<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></p>

<p>"Fernanda, you drink like a fish. Stupid! I am afraid
I have offended you."</p>

<p>"Give me wine," returned Fernanda, giving him such a
strange look that it quite upset him.</p>

<p>All the toasts having been now given, drunk, and responded
to, the cheerful company again dispersed. The
Pensioner and the officers averse to love-making were the
only ones who remained at table. They entered into
discussions on the best way of increasing, without much
affecting the Treasury, captains' pay by eight dollars,
lieutenants' by five, and ensigns' by three a month. Without
this reform, the interested parties explicitly stated that there
would very soon be a complete dissolution of the army, and
it would cease to be the pivot of the honour of the country,
and we should never rise to the dignity of other nations,
nor have prosperity, power and honour in our lives.</p>

<p>Jaime Moro went in search of Fray Diego and Don Juan
Estrada-Rosa and dragged them to the <i>tresillo</i> table. Don
Juan had lost and so was reluctant, but the plausible fellow
managed to convince him that the reason he had not won
in the morning was because he, Moro, never lost at that
time, but his luck always turned in the afternoon, so he had
a good chance of winning now.</p>

<p>Seated at the end of the table was Manin, who, without
interfering with the officers' conversation, employed himself
in lazily cutting slices of bread with his clasp-knife, and
putting large pieces in his mouth, which he washed down
with long draughts of Burgundy left in the bottles. He did
not approve of the dinner that Marañón, the master of the
café of Altavilla, had supplied them. After stuffing like a
savage, he said that all the dishes were just as if they came
from the perfumers, and that where there was plenty of
beans with black pudding, sausage and marrow bones, no
macaroni was wanted. It must be observed that to Manin
every dish he did not know was macaroni, which was a
source of much amusement to the Grandee.<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></p>

<p>Whilst concluding the meal so indecorously, he kept up a
stream of complaints against it, and Don Cristobal, at whom
he cast sundry angry glances, seemed to be held in some
degree responsible for it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door was opened with a great clamour, and
four girls rushed into the room in such a state of excitement
that the little party was quite taken aback. Without paying
any attention to the others, they all turned to Quiñones'
majordomo:</p>

<p>"Manin, a bear! Manin, a bear!"</p>

<p>"Where?" he asked, without moving.</p>

<p>"In the wood."</p>

<p>"Who put it there?"</p>

<p>The four stood astounded at this strange question. At
last one of them ventured timidly to remark:</p>

<p>"He came by himself."</p>

<p>"Bah! bah! bah!" returned the majordomo rudely.</p>

<p>And he returned to his lumps of bread with more ardour
than ever, which perhaps justified malicious people of the
town saying that they did not want to hear of the bears he
had killed, for he was nothing but a rustic clown.</p>

<p>"But, child, say how you saw it," said the sympathetic
Consuelo, who now put in her word, whereupon one who
was paler than the others advanced and said with some
difficulty:</p>

<p>"How fearful! <i>Madre mia</i>, how fearful! I thought I
should have died&mdash;because you see the bear&mdash;the bear
was horrible."</p>

<p>She was in such a state of panic, that she could only
utter these incoherent words.</p>

<p>Then the resolute Consuelo came forward, and said in a
firm voice:</p>

<p>"You see, Manin, this child was with us in the thickest
part of the wood a long way off. She heard a bird sing, a
mavis I believe&mdash;was it not a mavis? Very well, then she
heard a thrush, and she turned in the direction whence the<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
sound came. She went some distance, but could not come
across it. When she turned back, the bear came out of the
bushes, it attacked her, pulled her to the ground, and without
doing her any harm, we do not know why, it went off
and disappeared."</p>

<p>The famous bear-hunter then quietly rose from his seat,
and said in the quiet, firm tone pertaining to heroes:</p>

<p>"Let us go and see what it is."</p>

<p>He asked for a gun, and followed from afar by the pallid
damsels, he beat the wood. The only thing forthcoming
was a German pig, one of a pair that the count had to
improve the breed. The female had died, and the male
wandered about sad and alone in the depths of the wood
whilst his companion was metamorphosed into black
puddings and chops. There were strong suspicions that
the author of the attack was this widowed hog, but the
young lady of the adventure swore and maintained that it
had been a bear that had attacked her, and that they were
not to tell her it was that animal, because she had often seen
a bear in the zoological museum of the university.</p>

<p>Fernanda had gone off some time before with Garnet.
They repaired to the garden. There the young lady took
his arm and went several times up and down the same path,
where she had seen the count and Amalia.</p>

<p>"You are very much in love with me. Is it not so?"
she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>The Indian surprised, murmured: "Oh! yes; they say
that I am an ass, and it is true."</p>

<p>"And what do you feel. Come let us see. What do you
feel? Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"I, what?" he exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, what do you feel when you see me? What do
you feel when another man comes near me? Take the count
for instance. What do you feel at this instant with my
arm in yours? Describe me your sensations; what passes in
your mind."<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></p>

<p>"I, señorita.... I don't know how to describe it.
....Your word is my law as much as if I were one of
your family ... and it is the same with Don Juan your
father, although he may be a bit cantankerous.... What
does it signify to me if he be cantankerous or not? If I
married you, I have a house thank God.... Yes, and it
is not because I say it, but my house is worth more than his,
as you know. But we would travel first, in France, Italy,
England, whereever you like.... And if it cost us five
thousand dollars, what would that matter?"</p>

<p>Garnet held forth for some time in this strain, and
Fernanda turned a deaf ear to him. At last the boasting
tone bored her, and she said, with a touch of anger:</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet, sir?"</p>

<p>Poor Don Santos was quite crushed, and they went on in
silence for some time.</p>

<p>"How ugly all this is!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Everything! The house, the wood, the meadows, the
garden. See how hideous this magnolia is!"</p>

<p>"The house is very ugly, and very old; I have often said
so. Still, they might give it a coat of whitewash and paint the
balconies. The wood is worth nothing, it is no use, and it
takes up space that would be valuable for garden produce,
or wall fruit or such like."</p>

<p>Fernanda burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't you suffer sometimes from sadness, Don Santos?"</p>

<p>"Sadness? never. I am always cheerful. Only once
when I was robbed of eight thousand dollars by a knave I
had an angry fit which lasted for two days."</p>

<p>"How ugly the sun is, now seen through the branches of
the trees!"</p>

<p>"Would you like to return to the house?"</p>

<p>"No, take me to the river. I have a burning face, and I
should like to refresh it with a little water."</p>

<p>They went down by the meadows to the river, and there<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>
the heiress of Estrada-Rosa, in spite of Don Santos' advice,
bathed her face for some time. After she had dried it, they
slowly ascended the path to the house.</p>

<p>"How am I now? All right, eh? You can't think how
everything bores me here! I can't do any more; all this
wearies me. I was not born to walk about the meadows
like the cows. I like cities, salons, luxury. I should like
to travel as you say and see Paris, London, Vienna. How
stupid Lancia is! Is it not so? These eternal walks on
the Bombé! That San Francisco Park! That tower of
the Cathedral so black and so sad! Then always the same
faces. The only amusing person in Lancia is yourself.
Whenever I see you I cannot help smiling. Why do they
call you Garnet? I think your colour is more like a turquoise.
You had slaves there in America. Oh! how I should
like to have slaves! It is so tiresome to ask for things as
a favour! But, no, in America they have yellow fever. I
should prefer to go to China."</p>

<p>The more she went on talking, the more excited she
became, contradicting her own words, as her thoughts
became more and more incoherent. Don Santos tried to
make a remark, but she stopped him by putting her hand
on his mouth.</p>

<p>"Let me talk, sir! I want to tell you all."</p>

<p>The Indian began to be anxious as the excitement of the
girl went on increasing. She chattered away in a familiar,
rude sort of way.</p>

<p>"Give me a cigar."</p>

<p>"Fernanda! A cigar! You will be ill."</p>

<p>"Silence! what are you saying fool? I sick! You are
trying to annoy me! Give me a cigar or I will leave you
here."</p>

<p>The Indian took out his case, and the pretty heiress took
one, bit off the top with her sharp teeth, and asked for a
match. Garnet gave her a lighted one, at the same time
shaking his head in disapproval. When she had taken two<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
or three whiffs, she made a gesture of disgust and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What infamous cigars! Look, smoke it yourself."</p>

<p>And she put it in his mouth. There was no gesture of
disgust with Garnet as he smoked it.</p>

<p>"I should think I will smoke it!" he said with a smile of
beatitude. "They cost me two hundred dollars the
thousand, but now you have tried one, they are worth a
million."</p>

<p>"Come on and don't make impertinent speeches. Take
me to the house. This glare sickens me."</p>

<p>They reached the courtyard arm in arm. There a young
fellow called out to them:</p>

<p>"Where are you off to? The people are in the wood."</p>

<p>"Tell the people that I scorn them all," returned Fernanda,
with an angry gesture that provoked a smile from
the youth.</p>

<p>"You don't know the house?" she added, lowering her
voice and turning to Don Santos. "Then I will be your
guide, you shall see it."</p>

<p>They mounted the mouldy, shabby staircase, and
Fernanda, chattering continuously, did the honours of all
the rooms to the Indian.</p>

<p>"Here is the celebrated Countess's Chamber!" she
exclaimed with a peculiar intonation when they reached it.
"I am tired."</p>

<p>They went in and the girl shut the door.</p>

<p>"It is pretty, eh? It is the most beautiful and the
brightest room in the house. If this furniture could only
tell amusing secrets, it never would have done. Look, tell
me something to make me laugh or you will see me cry
like a very schoolgirl. See now, I am crying. Sit
down here you silly. What a pretty waistcoat you have
on! How well it shows the line of the figure!
Look at this couch. It is large, eh? It is wide, it is
beautiful, it is artistic. Look, then, I should like to burn<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>
it. To avoid sitting on it I am going to sit on your
knees."</p>

<p>And she suited the action to the words. Garnet lost his
head when he found himself with such a sweet burden, and
with incredible audacity he put an arm round her waist.</p>

<p>The girl jumped up as if she had been pinched.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, you brute? Do you think that we
are in the plantation and that I am some black wild creature?"</p>

<p>After looking at him for some time with angry eyes, her
face cleared and her lips expanded in a sweet smile.</p>

<p>"Do you love me very much?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said the Indian, in a teasing tone.</p>

<p>"Then you shall have one minute's happiness. See, I
will let you give me a kiss, mind only one, and you must
swear that nobody shall know about it."</p>

<p>The Indian made a solemn promise.</p>

<p>"Good! now give me the kiss here on the temple. The
first and the last you will ever give me in your life. Wait a
bit," she added once more jumping up. "For this kiss I
am to give you fifty buffets on your purple cheeks. Do
you agree to the compact?"</p>

<p>Garnet immediately consented. The young girl then
reseated herself on his knees, and bent her head to receive
the kiss.</p>

<p>"Good! now it is my turn!" she exclaimed with childish
merriment. "Prepare to receive your buffets. What
cheeks! <i>Dios mio</i>, how magnificent! Do you see how
blue they are? Well, I am going to turn them green.
Attention! One! the first. Two! the second. Three!
the third. Four! Five!"</p>

<p>The strong, small hand of the beautiful vixen struck into
the red cheeks of the Indian with no slight effect. His
eyes began to get as red and angry as those of a wolf, his
blood suddenly became inflamed, and with a sudden
movement, he seized her roughly by the waist.<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></p>

<p>Fernanda uttered a terrified cry.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Why are you angry?"</p>

<p>"Leave me, leave me, you brute!"</p>

<p>She struggled in desperation but she could not release
herself.</p>

<p>Once more free, she was perfectly sober. She cast a
vague, strange look at the Indian, and this look, suddenly
assuming an expression of horror, was fixed upon him as
upon some wild animal that had just attacked her.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Ah, yes!" she exclaimed
raising her hand to her forehead. "My God! What has
come to me? Am I dreaming?"</p>

<p>Then once more fixing her angry, menacing eyes upon
him, she cried in a rage:</p>

<p>"What are you doing standing there? Leave the room
immediately! Leave the room! leave the room!" she
repeated with a voice which grew louder each time.</p>

<p>But when the Indian got as far as the door, she rushed
before him, flew along the passages, and when she reached
the staircase she fell down in a swoon.</p>

<p>She was lifted up and every care was bestowed upon her.
When she recovered consciousness a torrent of tears
streamed from her eyes, and continued all the afternoon.
And when the party started for home she was still weeping.</p>

<p>"Did you see that this girl of Estrada-Rosa cried from
the effects of wine?" said Captain Nuñez, laughing.<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class="head">THE MASQUERADE</p>


<p class="nind">S<span class="smcap">hortly</span> before the rosy dawn opened wide the windows
of the East, Satan, who rose in a mischievous humour, sent
the most knavish and wanton of the demons to Lancia
with orders to awaken it from its slumbers. So the
minister of hell waved his black wings over the city,
and gave vent to loud discordant laughter, which was
effectual in arousing all the inhabitants from their dreams.
They awoke with the most immoderate desires to upset,
make fun of, and laugh at all ruling authorities, to improvise
couplets, and say rude things. One of these
people, we can imagine it must have been Jaime
Moro, called his servant directly he had jumped out
of bed, and asked him with a smiling countenance if Don
Nicanor, the bass of the cathedral, would lend him his
instrument. The servant without replying, instantly left the
room, and soon reappeared with an enormous serpent
(wind instrument) in his hands. And without any respect
for his master, he applied the mouthpiece to his lips and
produced a sound like the roaring of a lion. Moro, lightly
attired as he was, made a pirouet and gave three or four
taps of the heel in sign of great appreciation, as if that barbarous
sound had touched the most delicate fibres of his
heart. After trying himself to produce the same noise and
ascertaining that he was quite equal to the achievement, he
dressed himself, and after taking a hurried breakfast, he
sallied into the street, wrapped in his cloak, under the<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>
folds of which he had put the instrument that had so
delighted him. He stopped everybody with a mysterious
wink, and retiring to the nearest portico, he, full of excitement,
showed them his hidden treasure. Nobody asked
what he was going to do with it. They smiled, squeezed
his hand significantly, and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"When is it to be?"</p>

<p>"To-night. The carriage leaves at twelve."</p>

<p>"They will escape us."</p>

<p>"Bah! all precautions are taken."</p>

<p>And he went on his way muffled up to the eyes, for the
cold was indeed diabolical.</p>

<p>The others not only smiled and pressed his hand, but
each of them took from the pockets of his overcoat or from
inside his gabardine some powerful instrument, albeit of an
inferior kind to the above-mentioned one, and Moro
applauded and praised each one, without boasting of his
own superiority. And so he continued his round-about
and tiring walk until he arrived not at Don Romana's
confectioner's shop, which was the usual glorious termination
of his morning expeditions, but at the house
of Paco Gomez. The place resounded with the quick
steps and many voices of a number of busy young
people. They were all working with great energy, and
with a diligence rarely seen in workshops. Some were
cutting out banners, others were moulding cardboard
masks, some were painting black letters on the sides
of a lantern, some were dressing up two guy figures in
gorgeous attire, and some were trying the mouthpieces
of various wind instruments and serpents similar to
that brought by Moro. The scene of action was an
immense dismantled room. Paco Gomez lived in the
palace of a marquis, to whom his father was majordomo
and who never came to Lancia. The implacable practical
joker was a vigilant and careful director of all the work of
his companions, leaving the room every minute to give<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>
orders to the servants, or to receive some message sent to
him. Never was he more indefatigable. He was generally
rather disagreeable, and even with his jokes he brought to
bear a certain scornful manner, either real or assumed, that
made him more formidable. But now he strained every
nerve in the matter, for it was a question of the most
stupendous and best-arranged farce that the town of
Lancia had ever witnessed since the monks of San Vicente
came to found it. The cause of it was that Fernando
Estrada-Rosa was to marry (the pen scarcely dares write
it), Fernanda Rosa was to marry (how difficult it is to say
it), was to marry Garnet!</p>

<p>From the time of the memorable scene at the Grange,
Fernanda lived in a stupor of misery, in a depression of
body and soul that alarmed her father. The doctor was
sent for, and he said it was nothing more than a nervous
attack, which would be cured by a journey to the court,
drives and amusements. But the girl absolutely refused to
try these remedies. She declined drives, theatres, parties,
and, still more, a journey anywhere. She only went from
her room to the dining-room, and from thence to her
father's room, where she only stayed a short time. She
had no energy to go on to the second floor, nor spirit to
enter into, and direct the duties of the servants. She was
mostly shut up in her own room, where she had nothing
to do, and she would throw herself into a chair and remain
for a long time motionless with her hands on her knees
and her eyes fixed. Sometimes she began to read, but
finding that the book conveyed nothing to her mind, she
ended by casting it aside. Sometimes she appeared at
the window, and remained whole hours with a miserable
face upon the balcony, whilst her eyes were fixed on space,
or on a point of the street without seeing the passers by, or
replying to the many greetings made to her, or noticing
that she was making herself an object of curiosity to the
neighbours. But all at once she was seized with a desire<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
to go to Madrid, and the journey had to be arranged
instantly. She expressed her wish in the morning, and by
the evening the father and daughter were in the diligence,
so eager and vehement had the girl been in demanding the
journey. Once started, her state of mind was completely
changed. She threw herself madly and wildly into all the
pleasures of Madrid that were attractive to a rich, beautiful,
provincial girl. She passed two months in the intoxication
of theatres, drives, grand evening parties, and concerts.
A nervous sort of cheerfulness seemed suddenly to have
taken possession of her, and she appeared happy in the
midst of the noise and whirl of society, where she was soon
known by the nickname of "The African." To add to
the gaiety of her life, she liked to dine at cafés and restaurants
like a dissipated youth. Don Juan was divided
betwixt his pleasure of seeing her contented, and the acute
sense of discomfort that the disorganised life, so contrary
to his usual habits, and age, caused him.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as they were returning from the drive on
the Prado, Fernanda suddenly began sobbing violently.
Don Juan was astonished and taken aback, for she had
been laughing all the afternoon, and making fun of a certain
youth who persisted in following the carriage.</p>

<p>"What has come to you? Fernanda, my daughter!"</p>

<p>The girl did not reply. With her handkerchief to her
eyes, and her body shaken by her sobs, she only wept more
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Fernanda! <i>por Dios</i>! people are looking at you!"</p>

<p>The crying then changed to an attack of nerves, and Don
Juan told the coachman to drive home at once. But before
arriving there, the young girl ceased weeping, raised her
head, and said in a tone of determination:</p>

<p>"Papa, I want to go back to Lancia!"</p>

<p>"All right, my daughter; we will go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No, no; I want to go now, at once."</p>

<p>"But think, there is only one hour before the train goes."<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></p>

<p>"There is plenty of time."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to have their things
packed in the trunks and to rush in haste to the station, and
the nerves of the excited girl were only somewhat calmed
when the whistle of the engine announced their departure
and they were off over the arid tracts of land outside Madrid.</p>

<p>The day following her arrival at Lancia, she did not
appear to greet her father, nor to take chocolate with him
as usual. When the father was thinking of calling her, a
servant suddenly entered his room looking pale and
agitated.</p>

<p>"The señorita is taken very ill!"</p>

<p>Don Juan repaired to his daughter's apartment, and
found her in all the agonies of violent sickness.</p>

<p>"Quick! fetch the doctor!" cried the poor father.</p>

<p>Fernanda made a negative gesture, and weakly muttered:
"No; send for the father confessor."</p>

<p>But no notice was taken of this remark. The doctor
came, and after carefully considering the case, he called
Don Juan aside and said to him:</p>

<p>"Your daughter has taken a large quantity of laudanum."</p>

<p>"For what?" asked the father without understanding.</p>

<p>"For the reason that these quantities are generally taken&mdash;to
poison herself."</p>

<p>"Daughter of my soul! what have you done?" cried the
unhappy parent, and he was about to rush back to his
daughter's room, but the doctor detained him.</p>

<p>"She is in no danger now. She has brought up all the
poison, and with the medicine I am going to give her she
will soon be quite herself. The important thing now is to
avoid a repetition of the act."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I will see about that."</p>

<p>And he ran to his daughter's room, but he could not get
a word out of her; she persisted in asking for the father
confessor. At last he went himself to fetch the priest, and
soon returned with him.<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></p>

<p>During the confession Don Juan walked up and down
the wide corridor of the house, a prey to burning curiosity.
At last the father confessor appeared, and without replying
to the father's dumb look of inquiry, he took him by the
hand and conducted him to his own room, where they shut
themselves in. When they came out at the end of an hour
the old banker's cheeks were on fire, his white hair was in
disorder, and his eyes showed signs of weeping. He bade
farewell to the canon on the staircase and went back to his
room, where he remained with the door locked. There he
stayed all day and all night, without heeding the messages
that his daughter sent him to come and see her.</p>

<p>The father confessor offered himself to interview Garnet
and make all the arrangements. The Indian chuckled with
delight when he learnt what was wanted. But his plebeian
nature and avarice, which had always been his ruling
passion, turned his head. When the canon came to discuss
the matter with him, he found him completely changed; he
hesitated, grunted, shook his head, talked in broken phrases
of the luxury that Fernanda had been brought up to, and
of the great expenses accruing to matrimony. In short, he
asked for a <i>dot</i>. The father confessor, who was a just man,
full of feeling, could not contain himself before such low
conduct, and he overwhelmed him with insults. But the
churl did not mind that. Being sure of Don Juan's
daughter, he stood his ground, laughed like a beast,
scratched his head, and muttered some coarse remark which
increased the canon's anger.</p>

<p>When, with many evasions, he had to acquaint Don Juan
with what had happened, the disgraced parent was nearly
mad with despair and anger. He tore his hair, used very
strong language, and spoke of shooting his daughter and
then himself. With much trouble the canon succeeded in
calming him. At last he listened to reason and the negotiations
went on, and after disputing like merchants over the
amount of the <i>dot</i>, it was settled what it should be, and<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>
Garnet consented to give his toad-like hand to the most
highly prized girl in Lancia at that time.</p>

<p>But the worst had to come. Fernanda had to be told.
When she learnt that a marriage was arranged between her
and Don Santos, she was utterly overwhelmed with dismay,
and she fainted away. When she came to, she plainly said
that she would never do it, no, not if they flayed her alive.
Neither her father confessor's remarks, nor the prospect of
disgrace, nor the tears of her father, could persuade her. It
was only when she saw her frantic parent put the mouth of
the revolver to his temple to take his life, that she rushed to
stop him, promising to accede to his wish. And this was
how this unnatural marriage came about.</p>

<p>When the noble sons of Lancia learnt the arrangement,
they were all overwhelmed with disgust. An immense
wave of shame swept into their cheeks. This wave of feeling
only came to Lancia with such marked effect when
there was a question of fate favouring some Lancian more
than was just. If somebody drew a successful lottery
ticket, or got some good appointment, or if it were a question
of a marriage with a rich woman, or a great success in
business, or somebody got famous by his talent, the fine
perspicacity of the inhabitants of Lancia was in revolt, and
at once set to work to depreciate the money, the talent, the
instruction or the industry of the neighbour, and to put
things in their true light. Such a feeling might easily be
confounded with envy, nevertheless the truly observant
would soon gather from the remarks in the gatherings at
shops and in the gossips in the streets, that it was only love,
albeit it might be too warm, which prompted them to deteriorate
the merits of their neighbours and thus generously
to renounce the reflected glory which might have accrued
to them from a false conception of their value. The
marriage of Garnet caused profound astonishment, which
was followed by an outcry of indignation. Never were
the cheeks of Lancians so dyed with shame as they were<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
at that moment; not even when the press of Madrid
happened to eulogise a certain comedy written by a son of
the place. What rude remarks ensued, first against Don
Juan, and then against Fernanda! Strange to relate, the
young men were wild with rage; they maintained that
legislation was deficient if it had no power to prevent such
unnatural proceedings. The result of all this was that the
turbulent feelings aroused by the news were to be vented
by the youths of Lancia in a stupendous farce, of which we
have witnessed the inaugurations, to testify to their profound
disgust at such an out-of-the-way marriage.</p>

<p>The persons concerned heard of the plan, and they tried
to evade the blow by keeping the day of the ceremony
secret, and then to have it celebrated outside the place.
But their precautions were of no avail. The young men
found out that the marriage was to be in the early days of
February at the estate that Estrada-Rosa had, half a mile
from Lancia. Spies were placed in the Calle de Altavilla
and round about Garnet's house to prevent them going off
unobserved, and a thousand ingenious plans for the annoyance
of the bridal pair were hatched in the most fertile
brains of the town. As the preparations for the carnival
were at the same time, it was decided that the first blow
should be in the form of a great burlesque masquerade that
was to leave the house of Paco Gomez at twelve o'clock
and parade the streets. In a carriage drawn by four oxen
arrayed in pink calico, with their horns adorned with
branches there were three mummers which were supposed
to represent Fernanda Estrada-Rosa, her father, and Garnet,
the latter in a cocked hat. From time to time the carriage
stopped, and they performed such a ridiculous farce that
the people roared with delight, and crowds gathered to
witness it. Fernanda was made to kiss Garnet with transports
of enthusiasm, and he being smaller could only
encircle her with his arms below her waist, and Don Juan
meanwhile was laughing and shaking a bag of money.<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>
Occasionally another mummer appeared from the bottom
of the carriage, and he was supposed to represent the
Conde de Onis. He gave Fernanda a kiss, turned his back
on Garnet, and then vanished as quickly as he came. As
this pantomime was to be performed in the Calle de
Altavilla, in front of Estrada-Rosa's very house, the scandal
was dreadful, and the crowds immense. Don Juan in a
paroxysm of anger acquainted the Governor, who was a
great friend of his, with the facts, and determined to leave
with Fernanda the next day. The malicious youths, who
had foreseen this determination, had contrived means to
render it ineffectual, and they had prepared as we have
seen a grand performance of rough music for the night.</p>

<p>It had to be ready betimes, for the marriage had not yet
taken place, but they did not want them to escape without
it. Armed then with as many noisy instruments as they
could muster, with great glass slides on which were painted
the same grotesque figures of the carriage, with coarse
designations below, three hundred youths assembled in
Altavilla with torches in their hands, and they were accompanied
by half the people of the place, who encouraged
them with their laughter. The noise was horrible. When
it ceased, a voice was heard to shout some indecent
couplet, upon which the hilarity became outrageous.
Lieutenant Rubio, always original, crept along the cornice
of the chapel of San Fructuoso, situated almost in front of
Estrada-Rosa's house, and rang a bell. Paco Gomez went
swiftly from one group to another prompting them in the
most insulting couplets, so that the chief points should be
given in the loudest tones. Moro went on blowing his
serpent enough to hurt his lungs, whilst the Chatterbox
who had been one of the most active promoters of
the "rough music," treacherously entered the house of Don
Juan, pretending to come like a faithful friend, when in
reality he was spying out what was going on there. But the
political chief thought it was time to officiate as Neptune<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
and calm the stormy waves. When the "rough music"
had got so far, he sent to Altavilla, Nola, the head of the
municipal guards, accompanied by two of the company, who
happened to be Lucan the Florén and Pepe le Mota, with
orders to stop the scandal and clear the street. The
Lancians had long given up recognising the divine origin of
authority, when it was represented by Florén, or Pepe le
Mota. And not only did they cast a doubt upon their
right divine, but when they saw them from afar the spirit
of rebellion seemed to increase. Was this because the
Lancians were predestined by the blind impulses of their
nature to war against the established order? It is not very
probable. None of the historians of Lancia have noted
rebellion against institutions as an especial characteristic of
the race. It is more natural to suppose that what irritated
them most was the nose of Nola, which was just like the
button of an electric bell, and the unpleasant voice of
Lucan the Florén, and the monstrously bent legs of Pepe le
Mota. Besides, these respectable agents of government
authority were quite cognisant of the anarchical tendencies
manifested sometimes by the people of Lancia. But they
never thought that their appearing without proper precautions
among the crowd of Altavilla, would entail their
leaving it without truncheons, without sabres, without kepis,
and with buffeted cheeks. Nevertheless, such is the recorded
account.</p>

<p>The political chief, not wishing to submit blindly to the
decrees of fate, sent immediately for the lieutenant of the
civil guard to come with eight of his company, to avenge
the unfortunate Nola, Lucan, Florén, and Pepe le Mota.
Inflamed with success the harlequins of Altavilla tried to
resist. In the meanwhile the lieutenant, a prey to martial
ardour, ordered all swords to be unsheathed, and with a
fierce smile he charged upon the crowd like a wild boar,
and all the Lancians were terrified at the sight. There was
a strong tendency to retire from the field of battle, but at<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>
that moment somebody infused courage into their hearts
by holding out deceptive hopes of victory. "Down with
the civilians!" "Down with the cocked hats!" "Death to
the potato-face!" Such were the seditious cries that issued
from the throats of those rash youths. And some stones
were thrown at the same time. The trombones, bassoons,
and cornets à piston, of which the harmonious strains had
accompanied so many mazurkas in the bosom of peace, were
suddenly transformed into warlike weapons, shining formidably
in the light of the torches. The cocked hat of the
lieutenant was struck ignominiously to the ground by one of
them. Whereupon he picked it up, and his bellicose spirit
was so stirred, that a line of foam encircled his lips, and he
rushed into the battle with his eyes aflame and breathing
hardly. Then the youths of Lancia rallied with renewed
vigour, whilst menacing cries filled the air, and the
swords of the civilians were soon heard upon some of their
backs.</p>

<p>The retreat of the fine young fellows of Lancia on that
memorable night, when pursued by the bloodthirsty civilians,
was like the flight of a herd of deer from jackals.</p>

<p>The ground was strewn with bronze instruments, witnesses
of the fray. The indomitable lieutenant gave vent
to his anger for some time in the streets, animating his
company with strong interjections, and urging his party on
to the pursuit of the rebels, like a hunter calling his pack of
hounds in pursuit of a stag.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Paco Gomez, being persistently followed
by cocked hats, found himself obliged to avoid a blow by
jumping into the larder of the confectioner shop of Don
Romana, where he fell headlong to the ground on a dish of
soft eggs, and completely destroyed a magnificent burrage
tart destined for the precentor of the cathedral. And it
was the same with Jaime Moro, who, after losing Don
Nicanor's serpent in the fray, narrowly escaped being
immolated by the magnificent sabre of a civilian. It was<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>
only by taking the precaution of lowering his head, when
the blow was struck, that he escaped an effusion of blood.
The sword came in contact with the wall of a house, doing
no little damage thereby; and months afterwards, Moro
delighted in showing as a trophy the piece that was broken
away, to strangers who came to Lancia, and with the relation
of his prowess on that memorable night, his heroic heart
was filled with pleasure.</p>

<p>Many others of those magnanimous youths underwent
considerable discomfort from their conduct; some from the
sword-cuts, and the majority from the falls and the shocks
which resulted from the disbandment. Nevertheless the
victory was not gratuitous for the agents of the government.</p>

<p>Besides the destruction of the cocked hat of the lieutenant,
and several contusions of his subordinates, the constitutional
power suffered an important reverse in the
person of one of its oldest representatives&mdash;in the person of
Nola, the head of the municipals. As we know, this person,
who was so unpopular in Lancia on account of the shortness
and excessive roundness of his nose, lost in the first
struggle his kepis, his sword, and the honour of his cheeks.
Anger and revenge reigned in his heart. But he could not
do anything to gratify these feelings, because he was
deprived of all coercive means. Instead, however, of
prudently retiring to the portal of the Ecclesiastical Court,
like Florén and Pepe le Mota, he remained in the middle
of the street contemplating the battle with anxiety, and on
seeing that it was going in favour of the institutions that he
represented, delight overflowed his municipal heart.</p>

<p>"Good luck to the guardians! Long may they have it!
Down with the rabble! These vagabonds are punished
for once!"</p>

<p>Such were the bellicose cries that issued from his throat.
Nevertheless, when least expected, considering that his
enemies were flying in complete confusion, he received a
blow on his button of a nose from what turned out to be<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
the smooth, compact surface of a piece of lime. The
whole of his nervous system was affected by the blow, and
being unable to withstand such a shock, he fell senseless to
the ground, after his brave spirit managed to utter the
melancholy remark, "I am undone! These shameless
fellows have done for me!"</p>

<p>So fell that valiant supporter of order, that brave fellow,
who had always been victorious in his incessant struggles
with the vagabonds of the suburbs. He was lifted up and
taken into Don Matia's apothecary's shop which happened
to be near. From thence he was taken to the hospital, and
the town lost its protecting shield for some days, for neither
Lucan el Florén nor Pepe le Mota could be compared with
Nola in energy. Whilst these events were going on in
Altavilla and the adjacent streets, Don Juan Estrada-Rosa,
a prey to indescribable rage, was pacing his room
and tearing his hair. The hypocritical consolations of the
Chatterbox, or as he was also termed the Magpie of Sierra,
were powerless to calm him; and he talked of rushing into
the street and avenging himself upon the insolent mob.</p>

<p>"What has my poor daughter done to them?" he exclaimed
with a trembling voice which nearly broke into
sobs.</p>

<p>Fernanda had retired early to her room and gone to bed.
It is difficult to know whether the excitement in the street
conveyed anything to her or not. When Don Juan after a
sudden resolution went up to her room to waken her, the
eyes which encountered the candle that he lighted, were dry
and brilliant, without signs of having either slept or wept.
He told her to dress immediately, and he gave orders to
the servants to light all the lights of the house, so as to
deceive those without, and he then went out with her by
the coachhouse door which led into a little solitary street.
They were only accompanied by Manuel Antonio, and
they went by the quietest streets to the house of the
Pensioner. Once there, they sent a message to Don Santos<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>
for him to come immediately and another to the father
confessor. When they had both arrived, the father,
daughter, and these two gentlemen, with Manuel Antonio
and Jovita Mateo, sallied forth secretly from Lancia by the
high-road of Castille. After going some way they waited
for the coach that Don Juan had ordered. The six had to
manage as best they could in the little carriage, and it fell
to Manuel Antonio's lot to sit on the box. Half an hour
later they were at the banker's country-house. An altar
was quickly erected, and before the morning broke, the
father confessor blessed the union of the affianced pair.
Fernanda did not open her lips the whole way, and she
preserved the same silence during the preparations for the
ceremony. She appeared tranquil, in a state of absolute
indifference, or rather of somnolence, like a person who
having been violently awakened from a dream is hardly
conscious of what is going on around. And this lethargy
continued after pronouncing the "Yes" before the altar.
Neither the affectionate, eloquent conversation of the priest,
nor the incessant jokes of Manuel Antonio during the
breakfast, nor the caresses of Jovita, nor the assumed rough
sort of cheerfulness of her father, could draw her from her
strange absence of mind. The day broke, a sad, foggy day
that filtered through the windows in a melancholy fashion.
They all did their best to seem cheerful; they talked in a
loud voice, they made fun of the servant's dullness, and
Manuel Antonio's fear of some <i>contretemps</i>. Nevertheless,
a deep sadness pervaded the atmosphere. When there was
a pause in the conversation, the brows wrinkled and the
countenances darkened, and when it was resumed the
words sounded melancholy in the luxurious dining-room.</p>

<p>The bride retired to change her dress, and she soon reappeared
with the same impassive demeanour.</p>

<p>According to Don Juan's arrangements they were to go
immediately to the next town and there take the postchaise.
The insulting people of Lancia were thus to be frustrated.<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
When they went down to the garden, where the carriage
was waiting, a cold, fine rain was falling. Fernanda kissed
her father and got into the carriage. On receiving that
kiss on his cheek, the poor old man felt as if a current of
cold air passed through him paralysing his members and
freezing his heart.</p>

<p>The priest cried:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Fernanda, take care of yourself, Fernanda.
Good-bye, Santos. Come back soon."</p>

<p>And so they were off. In less than an hour they arrived
at Meres, waited for the diligence, and got in. The attentions
of Garnet could not provoke a smile or gracious word
from the lips of his bride, but his grotesque gestures and
the nonsense that he talked sometimes brought a look of
fatigue and disgust into the young girl's marble face. She
slept at intervals or looked with vacant eyes at the landscape.
When they arrived at the neighbourhood of Leon
it was night.</p>

<p>But what happened at Leon? On arriving at the place,
where the diligence changed horses, they found a large
crowd of people, they heard rough voices and the discordant
sound of musical instruments with the jingling of
bells, and large transparent pictures were seen waving over
the crowd.</p>

<p>Paco Gomez, being richer in resources than Ulysses, had
written beforehand to some friends of his at Leon, suggesting
that they should organise some rough music when
Garnet and his bride passed that way. Everything was in
readiness. Nevertheless the preparations would have come
to naught had it not been for the treachery of Manuel
Antonio, for on his arrival at Lancia he secretly made Paco
acquainted with all that was taking place. Whereupon
Gomez profited by the telegraphic communication, recently
instituted, and put himself in communication with his
followers. Fernanda was some time in realising that this
excitement was on her account, but when some cries that<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
reached her ears made her sensible of the fact she turned
pale, her eyes dilated, and uttering a cry she threw herself
against the little window with the intent of throwing herself
out, but Garnet caught her by the waist. The young girl
struggled for some moments in fury, but not being able to
free herself from those strong bear-like arms, she threw
herself back in the seat, covered her face with her hands,
and burst into passionate sobbing.</p>

<p><i>Dios mio!</i> Her sin had indeed been great, but what a
fearful punishment!<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class="head">FIVE YEARS AFTER</p>


<p class="nind">F<span class="smcap">ive</span> years have passed. The noble city of Lancia has
changed little in appearance and still less in customs; several
gilded cages in the form of gorgeous houses, built with
Indian money round about the San Francisco Park; foot-ways
in various streets that never had them in former times,
three more lamps in the Plaza de la Constitución; a
supplementary municipal guard that owed its existence, less
to the necessities of the service, than to the efforts of the
justice of the peace, a fellow of excellent ideas almost
entirely devoted to Venus, and whose propitiatory sacrifices
to Vulcan were only made at the expense of the municipality;
in the Bombé promenade a few bronze statues with
falling drapery of which the erection caused great scandal,
and the magistrate Saleta was informed at the Grandee's
evening party that the half nude was a hundred times more
suggestive than the complete; a few silver threads in the
heads of our old acquaintances; and the radiant countenance
of Manuel Antonio, the most fetching of all the sons
of the famous city, showed signs that his beauty was
on the wane, like a dream fading in the cold wind of
morning, or snowdrops falling in the silence of a day in
winter.</p>

<p>The same vegetative, dull, sleepy life; the same gatherings
in the shop-parlours, where the sweets of slander were
regaled; and personal nicknames still weighed like lead
upon the well-being of several respectable families. On<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
sunny afternoons there were the same groups of clerics and
military airing themselves in the Bombé. The great bells
of the cathedral continued to peal at certain hours, when
old lady-devotees were seen hastily wending their way to
the service of the rosary, or nones, and the monotonous
voice of the canons sounded solemnly in the silence of the
old vaulted aisles.</p>

<p>In Altavilla at the evening hour the eternal groups of
youths still laughed and talked in loud tones still loth to
let any pretty dressmaker, or plump servant-maid pass by
without rendering them homage with their eyes or lips, and
not seldom with their hands. And there in the heights of
the firmament there were the same clusters of greyish
clouds heaped together in solemn silence over the old
cathedral to listen on melancholy autumn nights to the wind
moaning through the high tin arrow on the tower. We
are in November. The Conde de Onis was accustomed
to ride on dull days as well as fine. The society of
men pleased him less and less. His character had become
more secretive and melancholy. Sin had destroyed the
feeble germs of cheerfulness which nature had put in his
heart. The gloomy, extravagant, fanatical temperament of
the Gayosos had been increased by the incessant gnawing
of remorse, his imagination was distorted, his slight activity
enervated, and his whole existence darkened.</p>

<p>People worried him. He imagined hostility in their
glances, and he saw hidden meanings in their most innocent
remarks that made his blood boil with rage. He
never dared enter churches, nor fall on his knees as
formerly before the bleeding crucifix in his mother's room.
If he heard hell mentioned, he fled in terror. He gave
plentiful alms to churches, and paid for Masses he never
heard; he put candles before the images, and in the
privacy of his chamber he puerilely amused himself in
asking fate, by the tossing of money, whether he would be
eternally damned or whether he would only go to purga<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>tory.
When he heard the chant of priests going to a
funeral he grew pale, trembled and stopped his ears.
At night he would suddenly jump up from sleep in a cold
sweat, crying miserably: "There is nothing but death,
nothing but death!" For some time he lived thus in
almost utter retirement without going out more than he
was made to by her, whose will ruled his own. But at last
his suffering became too intense, and he feared his gloomy
thoughts would upset his reason, so he took to riding or
walking in the country until he was tired out. The physical
fatigue relieved his mind, and the sight of nature soothed
his tormented imagination.</p>

<p>It was a dark, cold evening. The clouds pressed heavily
upon the hills looking towards the north, and hid the high
mountains of Lorrin that stretch like a distant curtain in the
west. Heavy rains had fallen converting the low part of
the town into a lagoon, and the roads, which went from
thence, into seas of mud. In spite of this, the count
ordered his horse to be saddled. He left Lancia by the
Castilian Road, and galloped amid splashes of mud across
meadows and chestnut woods. The yellow leaves of the
trees shone like gold, a thousand little streams made their
uncertain way down the base of the hill where the waters
were deposited on the pasture land with its gentle soft
green undulations. A darker fringe marked the stream
of the Lora, which hides itself mysteriously under the
osiers and thick lines of alder trees. The count, with his
head thrown back and his eyes half closed, inhaled with
delight the fresh humidity of the afternoon. The road
flanked the hill in gentle decline. Before crossing it,
and losing sight of the town, he stopped his horse and
cast a look back. Lancia was a heap, albeit not large, of
red roofs over which waved the dark arrow on the cathedral
spire. Below was a yellow spot&mdash;the oak-wood of the
Grange, and a little lower down were the old orange-coloured
turrets of his solitary house. The rain had ceased. A cold<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
wind dispersed the clouds and scattered them behind the
mountains; the sky became clear with the pale blue of
autumn days, and a few stars appeared like diamonds in
the horizon. The trees, mountains, streams and verdure-clad
valley shone indistinctly under the clearness of the twilight.
The count again put his horse to a gallop and quickly
descended the hill which hid Lancia from view. The wind
affected his senses and whistled in his ears producing a
sweet intoxication that dissipated the black clouds of his
imagination. Along the muddy road he only met a stray
herd of cattle with its driver, or a waggon drawn leisurely by
oxen, in which the carter carelessly slept at the bottom.
But before turning a corner he thought he heard the distant
sound of wheels and bells. It was the coach that
arrived at Lancia in the evening. As it passed by him, he
cast an absent glance into the interior, two large shining
eyes encountered his own, which gave him a sort of an electric
shock. He quickly turned his head again, but there was
nothing then to be seen but the back of the coach disappearing
in the distance. He pulled the rein of his horse
and followed it, but after a few moments in a stunned
sort of way stopped ashamed, and went on with his ride.</p>

<p>"It must be Fernanda." A passing, but very definite
feeling told him the fact. Nevertheless he might be
mistaken. He had heard no news of her arrival. He
knew that she had been a widow for some months.
Garnet had at last met his end like an ox from a fit
of apoplexy. But at the same time everybody knew
that the widow of the Indian bore a deadly hatred against
Lancia ever since the humiliating practical joke that her
compatriots had played on her at the time of her marriage.
The fact of her not having come there at the death of her
father the preceding year was a clear proof of it. The
Count thought of all this for some minutes, and then put
it from his mind, for his thoughts were changed by the
sight of a dark thick cloud which presaged another storm.<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>
But something indefinite and sweet remained in his mind,
which put him in a good humour. He turned the horse
and arrived at Lancia very late in the evening, very tired,
and covered with mud; but his heart was light and cheerful
without his knowing why.</p>

<p>Fernanda never hesitated for an instant. She saw him,
and knew him so well, that she even noticed the marks that
time and care had left upon his face. He seemed older,
and she thought she saw silver streaks in his long red beard.
At the same time she was agreeably impressed by the
suffering, anxiety, and sadness that she read in the eyes
that rested an instant upon her. The memory of her old
<i>fiancé</i> had always remained green in the depths of her
heart. Neither treachery, scorn, nor the thousand distractions
to which she resorted in her frivolous, restless, Parisian
life had been able to destroy it. If she had found happiness
in the power of wealth and health, she would not have been
open to that soft wave of sympathy which delighted her for
an instant. In such perverse pleasure in the count's sadness
there was the bitterness of the slighted woman, but there
was also a certain breezy, vapourous feeling like hope, which
sang and laughed in her soul, and dissipated the black
thoughts which had accumulated in her mind. It was
necessity, and not will which obliged her to return to Lancia
where she had vowed never again to set her foot. Her
husband had made a will in her favour, which his brothers
had disputed, and the consequence was a lawsuit, which was
soon given in her favour.</p>

<p>She came accompanied by an old servant of her father's,
whom she had made her <i>dame de compagnie</i>, and a majordomo.
From Madrid she had telegraphed to a cousin who, with
Manuel Antonio, two of the daughters of Mateo, and a few
more friends were awaiting her arrival on the badly paved
Place of the Post, where the diligence stopped. And then
followed embraces, huggings and kisses, questions, exclamations
and tears. The offended heiress of Estrada-Rosa<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
never thought she could have felt so much pleasure in
returning to her native place. In the ardour of their
affection, her friends almost carried her off to her house.
There they all left her with the exception of Emilita Mateo,
to whom Fernanda signed to remain. Then the two friends,
with their arms round each other's waists, went slowly up
that wide polished staircase which Fernanda had so often
trod as a child with bare feet. They soon shut themselves
in the old library of Estrada-Rosa to enjoy an hour of
sweet confidences. Amid smiles, kisses, and vows of eternal
friendship the history of those five years was told. Fernanda
talked of her late husband in a tone that lapsed from
compassionate to depreciative, for she had lived with him
in a state of antagonism of ideas and tastes that had kept
them apart. She had been neither happy nor miserable.
They had been five years of excitement, filled with crowded
streets, splendid theatres, magnificent hotels, gorgeous
dresses, many acquaintances, and not a single friend. Her
husband devoted himself to the satisfaction of her fancies
like some wild bear who obeys the whip of the keeper with
growls. They had had one child that had died at four
months old.</p>

<p>The skittish Emilita was very unhappy in her marriage.
Nuñez had turned out a fast man. Fernanda knew something
about it, but not much. It is not easy to go into
certain significant details in letters. He began very well,
but then he went wrong with bad companions; at first he
took to gambling, then to drinking, then he went after
women, and it was this last that Emilita felt so deeply. She
had willingly pardoned him all the rest. She had borne his
coming home drunk in the early hours of the morning, she
had pawned her earrings and her mantilla for him, but
she could not stand seeing him going into the house of a
bad woman who lived in the Calle de Cerrajerías. On
saying this the Pensioner's daughter burst into a torrent of
tears. The sight of her trouble was the more distressing,<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>
as a piquant sort of cheerfulness had always been her
peculiar characteristic. Fernanda caressed her tenderly
and wept with her. After some minutes silence she said:</p>

<p>"But do you go on loving him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, girl, yes," she exclaimed with rage, "I cannot help
it. I am more and more blindly in love."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>por Dios</i>! Your poor father must be very much
put out."</p>

<p>"As you can imagine! And the worst of it is," she
added, weeping bitterly, "that now he has returned to his
mania against the army. He says awful things about
soldiers! Yes, yes, awful! Directly I enter the house he
begins going on, on purpose to annoy me. My sisters
support him. They call us idle good-for-nothings, and say
that the contingent ought to be reduced."</p>

<p>Here the tender heart of the wife of Nuñez was torn
with sobs. Fernanda, who had also cried at the sight of
her affliction, could not help smiling.</p>

<p>"Your sisters, too?"</p>

<p>"I should think so! They all&mdash;they all want it to be
reduced!"</p>

<p>When the daughter of Estrada-Rosa had shown her that
the reduction of the land forces was not so easy as it seemed,
her spirits gradually rose. Then they arranged a surprise
for the Lancian society. Fernanda was to appear that
evening without previous announcement at the house of
Quiñones. The idea filled them both with childish delight,
and after concerting the details, Emilita went off, promising
to return and fetch her friend. It was ten o'clock when
they both mounted the stone steps, which were as damp as
ever, of the large seignorial stairway of the Quiñones. On
arriving at the top, Emilita would not let the servant
announce them, but opened the door herself, and pushed
Fernanda in. She was an apparition calculated to throw
all the guests into ecstasies. The daughter of Estrada-Rosa
was resplendent in a most elegant dress from one of the<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>
first modistes of Paris. Her beauty, which her compatriots
had only known in the bud, had blossomed during the five
years of refined and elegant life into a magnificent rose.
She had always been admired for the dignity of her bearing,
the brilliancy of her large dark eyes, and the delicacy of
her skin, but her beauty had acquired in Paris the necessary
adjuncts of the most finished manners, and a perfect taste
in dress&mdash;two distinctions she would never have attained
in Lancia. Her black silk dress revealed her neck and
shoulders, and a few strings of pearls, twisted in her hair,
were all the ornaments she wore. Amalia was the first to
see her, and the sight of her beauty caused a sudden chill
at her heart, but she recovered herself immediately and ran
to greet her.</p>

<p>"Oh! I knew you had arrived, but I never thought you
would be so kind as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their eyes met and that glance revealed the hatred that
burned in the depth of their souls. But circumstances were
changed. Five years ago Amalia had been the most
elegant and distinguished lady of the place; the only one
whose bearing and refinement of manners had raised her to
a more cultivated and spiritual sphere. But Fernanda now
had the advantage of her, for the former had visibly aged.
Many silver threads were noticeable in her hair; her complexion,
always pale, had lost its freshness; then her desire
and taste for dress had palled, and she had gone on taking
the tone of the ordinary commonplace society surrounding
her, and so had become more and more careless of her
appearance. A bitter smile wreathed her lips, as she
exchanged the necessary greetings with Fernanda, who
enjoyed her triumph with a grave, serene content.</p>

<p>The ladies immediately surrounded her. There was a
rush of kisses and embraces, accompanied with loud
expressions of delight. The men, who formed a circle
behind, also stretched out their hands and pressed that
of the beautiful traveller. And between so many congratu<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>latory
and pleasant greetings, and either from forgetfulness
or shame, nobody dared make any remark about the loss
that the young girl had recently sustained, and so there was
no allusion made to the cross old bear who slept his eternal
sleep in a cemetery at Paris. When the excitement of the
greetings had somewhat abated, Amalia took her smilingly
by both hands and exclaimed as her eyes swept over her
costume:</p>

<p>"Do you know mourning is very elegant in Paris?"</p>

<p>Fernanda made a <i>moue</i> of disdain.</p>

<p>"Dress is of little importance if mourning is in the
heart," said Maria Josefa, whose tongue had grown considerably
sharper in the five years that had passed.</p>

<p>Fernanda's cheeks flushed red. She was as ashamed as
if it were a crime at not feeling the loss of Garnet. Then,
irritated by the sense of antagonism, she was on the point
of showing her vexation; but she turned her back and began
talking to some other ladies.</p>

<p>At that moment the Conde de Onis came out of the
library and advanced to greet her. She gave him her hand
with an affectionate smile. Nevertheless, the dark circles
round her eyes betrayed her emotion. To hide her
feelings she went on to the library saying with assumed
levity that she would leave them all as she much wished
to see Don Pedro.</p>

<p>The noble Grandee was sitting in his chair with the cards
in his hand. His hair and his beard were white, but just
as erect and fierce-looking as ever. His energetic features
seemed more marked; his piercing eyes shone with a fiercer
fire. Moving with difficulty his great athletic body, so
helpless in the lower limbs, the lines of his face were
distorted with an expression of ferocious impotence that
inspired sadness and fear. But if he was broken down in
body, his proud spirit, seemed only to assert itself the more
remarkably. His respect for himself at bearing the name
of Quiñones increased every day, with his scorn for all other<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
people born under the stigma of any other name. Being
profoundly thankful to Heaven for the favour accorded him,
he would have thought it a sin to envy other men the
power of using their legs. What was the good of Juan
Fernandez being able to walk, run and jump if, after
all, he was only named Juan Fernandez? The only thing
that troubled him sometimes was whether it was befitting
the dignity of a Quiñones to have utterly helpless extremities,
and if it would not be preferable for them to
participate in the glory of the rest of his body. But such
unpleasant thoughts were put away by thinking that dead
or alive, those extremities occupied a superior position in
society.</p>

<p>When Fernanda entered the library he fixed his eyes on
her, and gave her a look, which took her in from head to
foot. Neither the girl's beauty, nor bearing, singularly
elegant as it was, seemed to please him, for he immediately
turned to the cards and said in an insolent, patronising
tone:</p>

<p>"Holla, little one! Is it you? When did you arrive?"</p>

<p>In spite of being offended at such a tone, Fernanda
saluted him affectionately.</p>

<p>"I am pleased to see you so well, dear," he continued,
"and I take the opportunity of condoling with you. You
know I have not written letters for years. I was sorry about
Santos. Do you hear, Moro? Are you ever going to give me
a decent card again? He was a good subject, an excellent
neighbour, incapable of harming any one. You will not get
another husband like him. He had one quality not easily
met with&mdash;modesty. In spite of the money that he made
he never pretended to go out of his sphere; he always
showed himself respectful to his superiors. Was it not so,
Saleta, that he was not one of those parvenu popinjays who,
as soon as they hear the clink of money in their pockets,
forget all about profits and percentage, as if they had never
gone in for them. Valero, sit down and say if this trick<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
will be mine. Have you come to settle here, child? or are
you going back to the <i>franchutes</i>?" (français).</p>

<p>Fernanda, who was keenly alive to all the gall of this
discourse, made a cold reply, and after a few words she
returned to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Don Pedro was vexed by the stamp of elegance and
distinction borne by the daughter of Estrada-Rosa. He
was angry to think that any one could rise in their turn,
albeit but a few degrees. He abhorred all that was foreign,
especially Paris, where he imagined the Los Quiñones had
no especial prestige. He even suspected with horror that
they were unknown there. But, as may easily be supposed,
he put such a disagreeable idea out of his head. For if it
took complete possession of his mind, what was left for the
noble gentleman? Death, and nothing else.</p>

<p>The party of <i>tresillo</i> was composed of old acquaintances.
Saleta, the great Saleta, whose lies went on flowing from his
mouth so glibly and easily that he always had to go on
lying. But Lancia almost lost in him one of its most magnanimous
amusing fellows; for, retiring on a pension three
years ago, he went and settled in the country, but he only
stayed there one year, for he became homesick for Lancia,
Quiñones' gatherings, and, above all, the jokes of his colleague
Valero; so he left the Gallician regions and came
back to live with the Lancians. Valero, having become President
of the Chamber, became every day more bombastic,
noisy, and lisping. He was sitting on the left of the
distinguished host. Facing him was Moro, the unattainable
ideal of all the marriageable girls, whose indefatigable head
easily stood twelve hours of <i>tresillo</i> without any ill-effects,
or fatigue. Of all the institutions created for men, the
most solid and respectable is that of <i>tresillo</i>. It may well
be compared to the immutable laws of nature, so unchangeable
is its stability. It was as true to Moro that a spade is
worth more than a club, as that falling bodies represent a
movement uniformly accelerated. And there, in the dark<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>
corner of the room, the celebrated Manin was sleeping in
the same armchair, with his short breeches, green jacket,
and hob-nailed boots. His hair was grey, almost white, but
that was not the worst of it, for the sad part was, that
he was no longer regarded in the place as a fierce hunter,
grown grey in contending with the bears of the mountains.
That legend had gradually passed away. His compatriots
were right: Manin was nothing but a country clown. His
deeds of prowess were now a subject of joke, and he was
looked upon as the old buffoon of the mad, illustrious Señor
de Quiñones.</p>

<p>Fernanda managed at last to withdraw from the congratulations
of her friends, and retired to a corner apart.
She was sad. The hostility of the people of the house
depressed her, but that was not the chief cause of her
sadness, although she tried to think so. The real reason of
it, ashamed as she was to confess it to herself, was Luis.
The kind greeting of her old <i>fiancé</i> had suddenly awoke all
her recollections, all her illusions, and all the joys and
sorrows of old times that slumbered in the depth of her soul
like birds amid the leaves of a tree. The agitation of her mind
was intense, but nothing, or very little, betrayed itself in her
grave and cold demeanour. Nevertheless, she felt a great
shock when she heard the following words close to her ear:</p>

<p>"How beautiful you have grown, Fernanda!"</p>

<p>She had been so full of thought that she had not noticed
the count had taken a seat by her side. Involuntarily she
raised her hand to her heart, and she replied immediately
with a smile:</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I am getting old, am I not?"</p>

<p>She made an effort, and looked him straight in the face.</p>

<p>"No; nothing but a few grey hairs in your beard, and
rather a weary look."</p>

<p>The trembling of her voice contrasted with the apparent
indifference which she chose to give to her tone.<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></p>

<p>The count instantly grew serious. He put his hand to
his brow, and at the end of some moments, he replied in a
gloomy tone, as if he were speaking to himself:</p>

<p>"Weary! yes, that is the right word. Very weary!
Weariness is exhaled from every pore."</p>

<p>Then they were both silent. The count was plunged
in profound meditation which brought a deep furrow to
his brow. After a while he renewed the conversation by
saying:</p>

<p>"I saw you before I came here."</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked with assumed surprise.</p>

<p>"On the road. I went out this afternoon for a ride, and
the post-chaise passed me. I knew you perfectly."</p>

<p>"Well, I did not see you. I only recollect meeting two
or three peasants, but I did not recognise anybody."</p>

<p>On saying this a wave of crimson surged to her face in
spite of herself. To hide her confusion she turned her
head, and her eyes met those of Amalia, brilliant and
steely, as they rested upon her. They looked at each
other for an instant. The feline mouth of the Valencian
was wreathed in a smile. Fernanda tried to respond by a
similar one, but it was a failure. She turned again to the
count, and talked of indifferent subjects, of theatres,
music, and projects of travel.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Luis became more and more preoccupied;
he seemed to lose his self-control, and talked at random,
as if his thoughts were straying afar. He was silent for
some moments, struggled to say something, moved his lips,
but instead of their articulating what he wanted, they expressed
something quite different, something trivial and
ridiculous that he was ashamed of directly he had said it.
Fernanda watched him attentively, regaining the calmness
and self-possession that he was rapidly losing. She
seemed absorbed in the conversation, describing her travelling
impressions with naturalness, and expressing her
opinions with unconcern, as if there had been nothing<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>
between them but an old and tranquil friendship. Finally,
availing himself of an instant's silence, he summoned
resolution to say:</p>

<p>"When I approached you, you seemed very thoughtful.
Of what were you thinking?"</p>

<p>"I do not recollect. Of what would you have me
think?"</p>

<p>The count hesitated a moment; then encouraged by the
gracious smile of his <i>ex-fiancée</i>, he ventured to say:</p>

<p>"Of me."</p>

<p>Fernanda looked at him in silence with playful curiosity,
under which shone a delight impossible to hide. The
count coloured up to the eyes, and he would gladly have
cut his tongue out before having said those two fatal monosyllables.</p>

<p>"All right," said the girl, jumping up from her chair.
"<i>Au revoir</i>, I am glad to see you friendly."</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said, turning back, as she was going
away, and glancing at him with two smiling, malicious eyes
that completed her conquest of him.</p>

<p>"Pardon, if my words offended you."</p>

<p>Fernanda tossed her head disdainfully and went off, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Repent sinner, or hell will have you!"</p>

<p>"Hell!"</p>

<p>This word, uttered at random, as a joke, gave him a
sudden shock, and called him back again to the habitual
tenor of his thoughts. All the Gayosos had lived under
the influence of this baneful idea. But the terror of his
ancestors seemed concentrated in his mind, tormenting and
maddening him to a degree. Amalia had had a hard
struggle to distract him for a little time from his scruples.
Therefore, when she now signed to him to come to her
she saw he moodily rose from his seat, and came
towards her with slow, unwilling steps. She had too<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>
much tact and pride to show any vexation at the short conversation
just held with his old <i>fiancée</i>. She received him
with the same smile, speaking with her habitually assumed
tone of cheerfulness, and she did not mention Fernanda's
name. But her pallid lips contracted with anger every
time his eyes turned towards the girl, which they often
unwittingly did.</p>

<p>A beautiful child with blue eyes and long fair hair now
appeared at the door with a servant.</p>

<p>"Oh, how late!" exclaimed the Señora de Quiñones.
"Why are you so late in bringing her, Paula?" she added
severely.</p>

<p>The servant replied that the child was so amused at
playing: "Let them give to the kite," that she cried
every time they wanted her to go to bed.</p>

<p>"Are you not sleepy yet, my treasure?" said the lady
drawing her to her, and passing her hand caressingly over
her curls.</p>

<p>The guests were very interested in the little creature,
and she went from one to the other, receiving caresses
from one and the other, and returning them with good-night
kisses.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Josefina. Until to-morrow, my treasure.
Have you been good to-day? And has your godmother
bought you a doll that shuts its eyes?"</p>

<p>The count regarded her with tears in his eyes, whilst he
made incredible efforts to master his emotion. He always
felt the same when he saw the child. When his turn came
he only brushed her fair cheek with his lips; but Josefina,
with the fine instinct of children, who always know who
loves them, threw her arms round his neck, and gave
evidence of particular affection for him. Fernanda also
regarded her with intense interest, with a curiosity so great,
that she opened her eyes wide. Josefina was six years old,
she had a creamy complexion, eyes of infinite sweetness,
and something sad and delicate about her diminutive<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>
person. One detected at once her likeness to the count.
When the child left him, his eyes met Fernanda's, and he
was so embarrassed, that he took a seat farther off.</p>

<p>Josefina was dressed with taste. The Señores de
Quiñones brought her up with every indulgence like
an adopted child. This had been for some time the
favourite topic of gossip in Lancia. The cost of her little
hats was guessed at with the greatest interest; the number
of her toys was commented upon, and calculations
were made as to what her marriage <i>dot</i> would be. But
such remarks ended by getting stale. It was only when
the subject came up, that some sarcastic allusion was
made, or some new discovery whispered. The child
came to a stop before a group, in which figured Maria
Josefa, the young lady with the long spiteful tongue,
and Manuel Antonio, as beautiful as the first rays of
morning.</p>

<p>"Listen, Josefina; who do you love best&mdash;your godmother
or your godfather?" asked he of the child.</p>

<p>"My godmother," replied the child, without hesitation.</p>

<p>"And who do you love most&mdash;your godfather or the
count?"</p>

<p>The child looked at him astonished with her large blue
eyes, and a shade of distrust passed over them, as, with a
frown on her beautiful brow, she returned:</p>

<p>"My godfather."</p>

<p>"But does not the count bring you lots of toys? Does
he not take you in his carriage to the Grange? Has he
not brought you the little waggon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is not my godfather."</p>

<p>The group received this reply with a smile. They knew
that the child lied, for Don Pedro was not a man to inspire
any one with affection.</p>

<p>"But I think the count is also your&mdash;fa&mdash;godfather."</p>

<p>"No such thing. I have only one godfather," returned
the child, now getting angry. And then she left the group.<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></p>

<p>She then went to where Amalia was, and placing herself
before her, she crossed her little arms upon her chest, and
making a curtsey, said:</p>

<p>"Godmother, your blessing."</p>

<p>Whereupon the lady gave her her hand, which the child
kissed with reverence. Then, taking her in her arms,
she kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>"You must go to bed, my daughter. Go and ask your
godfather for his blessing."</p>

<p>So the child went to the library. These old world
customs were a great pleasure to the Señor de Quiñones.
Josefina approached him timidly. That great paralysed
gentleman always inspired her with dread, although she
tried to hide it according to her godmother's injunctions.</p>

<p>"Señor, your blessing," she said in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>The pompous old Grandee paid no attention, and
looked at the cards he held in his hand, whilst wrapped in
his grey cloak with the red cross, he seemed to grow bigger
and bigger before the frightened eyes of poor Josefina.
She thought that there was nobody in the world more
immense, more imposing, and more worthy of respect than
that noble señor; and Don Pedro shared the same
opinion, so that all other beings with whom he came in
contact seemed a chaotic mass, in which only two or three
were possessed of any individual character. The child
waited, with her little arms crossed, for about a quarter of
an hour. At last the Señor de Quiñones, after playing a
good card, condescended to cast a severe look upon the
child which turned her pale. He then stretched out his
aristocratic hand with a gesture worthy of his namesake,
Peter the Great of Russia, and Josefina pressed her trembling
lips upon it and then withdrew. The bombastic old
fellow was not quite pleased at his wife treating the little
foundling with so much indulgence, but he consented
because it flattered his vanity, for Amalia, knowing his
weak point, said:<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></p>

<p>"Treating her like a servant is what anybody would do
in Lancia. We ought to do things in another fashion."</p>

<p>So Don Pedro could not but see the weight of that undeniable
truth. Josefina crossed the drawing-room to go
to bed. As she passed by Fernanda, she caught her by
the arm and dragged her to her. All the joy and love that
filled her heart overflowed with vehemence upon the little
creature whom she covered with kisses. She forgot all
about her rival whom she considered defeated. She only
thought that it was a child of his, his blood, his very image.
And she kissed with ecstasy those blue, deep, melancholy,
eyes, that creamy skin, and those yellow curls that surrounded
her face like a golden aureole.</p>

<p>"Oh, what beautiful hair! What beautiful curls!"</p>

<p>And she pressed her lips on the child's head with so
much feeling that she was not far from crying.</p>

<p>At that moment a sharp, imperious voice sounded in her
ears.</p>

<p>"Not gone to bed yet! you naughty girl."</p>

<p>And on raising her eyes, Fernanda saw Amalia with a
pallid face and compressed lips, take the child roughly by
the arm, and after giving her a sharp shake, she dragged her
to the door.<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class="head">AMALIA'S RAGE</p>


<p class="nind">T<span class="smcap">he</span> next morning Paula, by command of the señora, took
the child off to the ironing-room, sat her in a high chair,
and asked a young girl, who was working at the window, for
some scissors.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Josefina asked.</p>

<p>"Cut your hair."</p>

<p>"Why? I don't want my hair cut."</p>

<p>Whereupon she got down from the chair with determination,
but Paula turned back and put her up again.</p>

<p>"Be quiet," she said severely.</p>

<p>"I don't want to, I don't want to," she doggedly returned.</p>

<p>"It is certainly a shame to cut such beautiful hair," said
one of the girls who was ironing.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, child? An order is an order."</p>

<p>And taking hold of one of the precious curls of hair, she
cut it off with the scissors.</p>

<p>"Leave go, Paula!" cried the child, "I am going to tell
godmother."</p>

<p>"Yes, precious, go and tell your godmother, indeed?
All right, you shall tell her when it is done."</p>

<p>And paying no further heed to her protestations, and
letting the words fall on deaf ears, she went on with the
task quite undisturbed. But the child got down again,
angry and furious. Then Paula called the sempstress
Concha to her assistance, and she held her down on the<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>
chair until she was despoiled of every one of her curls,
after which they arranged what was left as best they
could.</p>

<p>"What a pity!" said the laundress again.</p>

<p>"It is not so bad, child," returned Paula, combing it with
admiration.</p>

<p>At that moment the señora appeared at the door of the
room.</p>

<p>"Godmother! come godmother! Look, Paula and
Concha have cut my hair."</p>

<p>Amalia advanced some steps, avoiding the child's gaze,
fixed her stern eyes upon her head and said in an imperious
and cold tone:</p>

<p>"That is not right. Shave it off."</p>

<p>And she went away with a frowning brow, whilst Josefina,
astonished, followed her with her eyes. Never had she
seen her godmother so cold and stern. She was sad and
thoughtful, and remained thus without making the slightest
movement, until Paula had accomplished her task.</p>

<p>The little head was soon as smooth as a melon. The
servants shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"Child of my soul! what have they been doing to you?"
exclaimed Maria, the ironer, with a tone of regret, although
she could not repress a smile.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, woman," retorted Concha with a shade
of bitterness. "Yes, she does look ridiculous."</p>

<p>She was a woman of five-and-twenty or more, extremely
small, almost as small as Josefina, with sharp, keen eyes, and
all the servants were afraid of her.</p>

<p>Paula laughed too and passed her hand over the little
creature's head.</p>

<p>"When we want a jar for the vinegar we shall know where
to go for it," continued Concha.</p>

<p>The wave of pity passed away. Guessing that the child
had fallen into disgrace, the servants became quite facetious,
exchanging jokes which were not pretty, but which made<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>
them nearly die of laughter. Josefina remained with her
head down, quiet and silent. Then the jokes began to
take effect, and two tears dropped from her long eyelashes.</p>

<p>"Crying for your little wig? What a shame to hurt her!
It is not your fault, but theirs who brought you up like a
princess, when you are only like us, and less than us," she
added in a low tone, "for we have got fathers."</p>

<p>"Come, Concha, drop that! Don't fret the little
monkey, you will soon have fresh hair," said Maria, in a
maternal tone.</p>

<p>The child, touched by the kindness, began to sob and
left the room.</p>

<p>When she entered the drawing-room in the evening like
that, the count could not repress a gesture of anger, and
cast an interrogative glance at Amalia, who replied to the
gesture and look with a provoking smile. And in a loud
voice she said that the child's hair had been cut by her
orders, for she had noticed that she was beginning to be
vain. It is so! and people flatter her so much that she has
become unmanageable.</p>

<p>The count, enraged, immediately took the opportunity of
repairing to Fernanda's side, where he renewed the conversation
of the previous evening. The two were
loquacious and affectionate. Fernanda related her life in
Paris with no lack of details; and Luis was particularly
expansive, not hiding the cheerfulness of his heart, and
talking with animation in spite of Amalia's angry glance
fixed upon him. During a pause, Fernanda raised her
smiling eyes to her <i>ex-fiancé</i> and asked him, but not without
a slight blush:</p>

<p>"Don't you know why the child's hair has been cut?"</p>

<p>The count looked at her without replying.</p>

<p>"Because I praised it yesterday, and allowed myself to
kiss it."</p>

<p>It was the first time that Fernanda took his secret for<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>
granted. He felt a great shock; his face grew red, and so
did hers. For some time neither of them could speak.</p>

<p>During the following days the count often walked down
the Calle de Altavilla, and he spent a great deal of time in
the Café de Marañón. Lancian society was moved to its
very foundation at such an important turn of events, and
henceforth he was an object of interest to three hundred
pairs of eyes. He gave up going every day to the Quiñones'
house, and went occasionally to the de Merés' little party,
as it continued to be called in Lancia, although only one of
the old ladies was now left in this world. Carmelita had
died at least three years ago. Only Nuncia the youngest
was left, and she was quite paralytic. From the armchair
to the bed, and from the bed to the armchair was all that
she could manage with great difficulty. She was also
deprived of moral support, as in her sister she lost her
protector from impulse. Since she was buried there was
no one to keep her in order. With the sudden promotion
to the category of persons <i>sui juris</i>, the poor "child"
was a prey to great distress, everything worried her, everything
was an insuperable difficulty. Those sharp scoldings
had been less overwhelming to her, for if they had caused
tears, they had been salutary in checking her juvenile
ebullitions, and so prevented the fatal consequences attending
her inexperience. Her guests were a few youths, and
several young men of our acquaintance, with a sufficient
number of graceful, pretty damsels who came to the house
on the look out for a husband. For the "child," in this,
and in every respect, kept up religiously the traditions
bequeathed by her sister. She was the firm protector of all
the courtships that arose in Lancia, however ill-advised
they might be. The little house of the Calle del Carpio
continued to be the forge, where the conjugal happiness of
the worthy neighbours of Lancia was forged. The most
constant visitor was Paco Gomez, because the house of the
Quiñones was closed to him in consequence of one of his<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>
remarks. A certain stranger meeting him in Altavilla with
a few others asked him how the Grandee came to be
paralysed.</p>

<p>"He is not really paralysed," returned Paco, for he is
not disabled at all, only his legs can't put up with all the
heraldry stuff that he has got in his head, and so they double
up rather than take a step.</p>

<p>This came to Quiñones' ears through a traitor, and he
gave orders he was henceforth not to be received. He was
the soul and the delight of the "child's" party, and the
incessant way he made fun of Nuncita kept all the guests in
a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"I say, Nuncita, look! Don't talk too much, for do you
know I saw your leg, and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The poor octogenarian blushed like a girl of fifteen.
Nothing could have confused her more than this inopportune
reference to the afternoon of the swing. Luis and
Fernanda took to seeing each other there once or twice a
week. Away from the angry eyes of Amalia, the count
found it very pleasant, and he recovered his serenity of
mind. They had long talks in a low voice without being
disturbed by anybody. On the contrary the "child" took
good care to give them room and opportunity. Nevertheless,
he still visited at the Quiñones' house, and he saw
Amalia secretly when she demanded it, but he was evidently
colder and more distant. She was perfectly aware of the
change, but she did not show her colours, and she did not
mention his <i>ex-fiancée</i>. However, one day she could not
help doing so.</p>

<p>"I know that you spend a great deal of time at the de
Merés' talking with Fernanda."</p>

<p>He denied it in a cowardly fashion.</p>

<p>"Take care what you do," she continued, fixing her eyes
on him, "for treachery may cost you dear."</p>

<p>He was so accustomed to the dominion of this terrible
woman that the words sent a chill through him, as if some<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>
misfortune were hanging over his head. But when he came
out into the street, away from the magnetic influence of
those eyes that upset him, he was conscious of an impotent
feeling of rage. "Why, after all, should she threaten me? Is
she my wife? What right has she to me? What we are
doing is a grave sin, it is a crime. Who can deprive me of
repentance, of reconciling myself with God and being good?"
Repentance had latterly been to him a vague desire due to
his love being on the wane, and to his great fear of hell.
Now it had changed into a real wish. Certainly it offered
several attractions. He would renounce the sin bravely,
purify himself, free himself from eternal fire&mdash;and then have
Fernanda.</p>

<p>For some time past there had been only one bright spot
in his criminal connection with Amalia&mdash;and that was
Josefina. This little creature, white and silent as a snow-drop,
sweet as a lily with the innocence of a dove, and the
tender melancholy of a moonlight night, was like a delicious,
refreshing balsam to his soul&mdash;a prey to remorse. How
often, when holding her in his arms, he had asked with
surprise how such an innocent, pure, divine being could be
the child of sin. But that same child caused him fresh
cruel torments. Never to see her alone, from day to day,
to be obliged to hide his affection for her, to have to kiss her
coldly like the others, and more coldly than the others, not
to be able to call her the child of his heart, not to hear her
lisp the tender name of father, sometimes saddened him to
a point of despair. On one or two occasions he had been
allowed to take her to the Grange. Then he passed hours
in ecstasy, holding her on his knees, and caressing her
passionately.</p>

<p>The child had become accustomed to these violent
expressions of affection and she liked them. Sometimes
she felt her fair head wet with the tears of her friend.
Raising her eyes in surprise she would see him smile, then
smiling too, she would reach up her coral lips for a kiss.<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></p>

<p>"Why are you crying, Luis? Have you a pimple?"</p>

<p>Josefina knew no more serious reason in the world for
crying. She loved Luis dearly, and his general coldness
saddened and surprised her. By degrees she had come to
understand with precocious instinct, that the count loved
her more than the others did, but he had to hide his feelings.
So she, following his example, also adopted an
indifferent manner with him when in public. But when
they were alone, she reciprocated his expressions of affection
with equal enthusiasm, and this without knowing why, without
accounting to herself for what she did.</p>

<p>From the day her godmother ordered her hair to be cut,
Josefina noticed that she had fallen into disgrace. She was
not now kissed with transports of delights, her slightest
wishes were not acceded to, and she was no longer the
constant source of interest in the house.</p>

<p>Amalia took to scolding her, using a cold, displeased
tone towards her, and the servants followed the example of
the señora. The poor child, without knowing what the change
signified, felt her little heart sink, she explored the faces of
those about her with her beautiful deep eyes, and tried to
decipher the enigma that they hid. She became daily more
grave, more retiring, more timid. And as she found she
was denied the toys or the sweetmeats that they used to
lavish upon her open-handed, she left off asking for them.</p>

<p>Amalia, instead of delighting as formerly in her infantile
ways, appeared to avoid them, she gave orders she was
not to be brought to her bed in the morning as usual.
When they met on the stairs, she passed by without looking
at her. At the most she would go up to her and say in a
displeased tone:</p>

<p>"You have not washed yourself yet. Go, see you are
put right." Or else, "They tell me you did not know your
catechism lesson. You are getting very idle. Take care
and be good, because if not I shall lock you in the cellar
with the rats."<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></p>

<p>She had formerly busied herself in teaching her, in
putting the needle into her hand, and guiding her little
fingers. Now she almost always left this task to the
servants. She lived in a state of gloomy preoccupation
which did not escape the domestics' notice. Josefina also
was conscious that her godmother was changed, not only
with regard to herself, but in her whole manner of life. And
so her mind gradually conceived the idea that she was sad,
and that she was suffering, and that this was the cause of
her bad temper. One day the lady was alone in her room.
She had flung herself in an armchair and sat motionless
with her head thrown back and her hands hanging down,
apparently asleep. Nevertheless, Josefina, who passed by
the room, and ventured to look through the crack of the
door, noticed that her eyes were open, very open, and that
she was frowning dreadfully. Without knowing what she
did, with the blind confidence that children have in themselves,
she pushed open the door and entered the room.
She went silently up to the señora, and throwing herself
suddenly on to her lap, and looking at her with timid
affection, she said:</p>

<p>"Give me a kiss, godmother."</p>

<p>The lady was startled.</p>

<p>"How is it you are here? Who gave you permission
to come in? Have I not told you not to come up without
you are called?" she asked, frowning still more
severely.</p>

<p>"I want to give you a kiss," said Josefina in a subdued
voice.</p>

<p>"Don't bother me with kisses, and mind you don't come
up again without permission."</p>

<p>But the child, overwhelmed with emotion, not knowing
to what to attribute this moroseness, and wishing to overcome
it at all costs, began to cry, as she threw herself once
more upon her lap and tried to reach her face.</p>

<p>"Give me a kiss, godmother."<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></p>

<p>"Go! leave me!" replied the lady, preventing her raising
herself higher.</p>

<p>The child was obstinate.</p>

<p>"Don't you love me? Give me a kiss."</p>

<p>"Go away, child!" she cried, in a fury. "Go away, at
once!"</p>

<p>At the same time she gave her a hard push, and Josefina
fell on to the ground where her head came against the leg
of a chair.</p>

<p>She got up, raising her hand to where she was hurt, but
she did not cry. A feeling of dignity, often shown by
childish hearts, gave her strength to keep from crying,
although her eyes were filled with tears. She cast one
look of unspeakable sadness on her godmother, and then
ran from the room. When she reached the staircase, she
threw herself down on one of the steps and burst into a fit
of sobbing.</p>

<p>The thorns of life were indeed piercing the delicate flesh
of that child whose path until then had been strewn with
flowers. Amalia's spite grew worse every day, and the
reserve and timidity of the child increased in proportion.
But as she was only a child, this sadness would vanish
when under the impulse of a fancy, and it was at such
moments that the coldness and spite of the lady were most
evident.</p>

<p>"Señora, Josefina does not want to put on her green
frock."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She says it is dirty."</p>

<p>Amalia then rose, repaired to the child's room, took her
by the arm, and shaking her roughly, she said:</p>

<p>"What is this pride? Don't you know, silly, that you are
only here out of pity? Take care and don't vex me, or one
day, when least expected, I will put you in the street where
you came from."</p>

<p>The servants heard these words and always bore them<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>
in mind. Until now Josefina had been brought up like a
child of the señores, now she was treated like an illegitimate
child, and afterwards like a little pariah. The servants now
took pleasure in paying off the little attentions they had
been formerly obliged to accord her, and the sharp rebukes
they had incurred on her account.</p>

<p>Concha in particular, the dwarfish maid, felt an
indescribable delight, peculiar to her malignant, spiteful
character, every time that the señora evinced in any way
her scorn for the adopted child. Josefina had a large,
cheerful room looking on to the garden. Although
Concha was head maid and dressmaker of the house, she
had a duller room that she shared with Maria looking on
to the street. Josefina's room had always been an object
of envy to her. More than once she had given strong
hints on the subject; and now, profiting by her mistress's
state of mind, she got permission to sleep in the child's
room under the pretext that Paula, who occupied the next
bed, snored so loudly. So she installed herself comfortably
there, and made use of the little girl's toilet things. A few
days later she sent her to sleep with Maria without saying a
word to her mistress. When Amalia did know of it, it had
been going on for some time, and she heard it without any
resentment at not having been told before, and she did
nothing to alter what had been done.</p>

<p>Soon after, she thought of another means of degrading the
child. Josefina dined at table with the señores. The
pompous old Grandee had not consented to this at first, but
he at last conceded to the importunities of his wife.
Concha, full of spite like her señora, set to intriguing to
deprive the foundling of this privilege. Exaggerating what
it gave to do, the mess that it made, and the disturbance
of the waiting at table, the little girl was finally removed to,
and located at, a little table, which was put in the ironing-room
near the kitchen. A few days after Amalia, in a fit
of bad temper, said that the double service could not be<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>
tolerated, and that she was to dine in the kitchen with the
servants. Concha sat her on a stool, pushed her a plate
of thick soup and a tin spoon saying: "Eat."</p>

<p>The child raised her head in amazement, but seeing the
malignant smile in the girl's eyes, she put it down again,
and began to eat without any protest whatever. Concha
was not pleased at this, for she wanted to see her rebel and
cry.</p>

<p>"What is it? Don't you like your spoon? Then, child,
you'll have to eat with it as I do, who am quite as good as
you. What do you take yourself for, you little fool? Do
you think because you wear a fine hat and a cambric
chemise you are a young lady? Young ladies don't come
in a basket covered over with dirty rags." And so she
went on, bursting into sarcastic, insulting laughter until poor
Josefina at last began to cry. Although the other servants
were not so malignant, they were pleased at the child's
humiliation. They ended by taking her part, whilst Concha,
relentless and colder and harder than marble, went on persecuting
her with the greatest cruelty. A few days later,
as Josefina was passing through the ironing-room to the
dining-room, she heard Concha say to Maria:</p>

<p>"I say, girl, have you ironed the foundling's clothes?"</p>

<p>She stopped, not knowing of whom they were speaking,
and cast an anxious look from one servant to the other,
until a simultaneous shout of laughter from them both
made her understand that they were speaking of her.</p>

<p>"Why do you call me a foundling?" cried the innocent
child, with difficulty repressing her tears. "I will go and
tell my godmother."</p>

<p>"Go run and tell her," returned Concha pushing her to
the door.</p>

<p>And henceforth she went by that name among the servants.
Amalia prohibited her being brought into the drawing-room
in the evening. The count, whose only chance
of seeing his child was on these occasions, asked for an<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>
explanation, and the lady replied that as she had to get up
early for her lessons, she required more sleep; but he did
not feel satisfied. He knew that some harm was brewing,
but fearing a worse evil he had the sense to be silent.</p>

<p>Then Amalia thought of a more direct way of wounding
the count. The child whom she had not only deprived of
her caresses, but of all her position in the house, was in a fair
way to be an extra little servant. In one instant the transformation
was completed. The señora gave orders for all
her hats and clothes to be put on one side, and for her to
be dressed in the poorest, oldest things out of the press;
that she was to be treated like the rest of the servants, and
perform little offices in the kitchen that were within her
power.</p>

<p>The courtship of Fernanda and the count was getting
more conspicuous every day. Although they abstained
from talking intimately in the house of Quiñones before the
jealous Valencian, she was not oblivious to what was going
on. Her eyes, like two rays of light, seemed to pierce her
lover's brain and read what was there: Luis was in love
with his old betrothed. The adulterous connection weighed
on his mind like a heavy stone. She, the loved and preferred
of former days, was now old and faded beside that
splendid rose who had just reached perfection. If he had
not given her up already, it was through his weakness of
character, through the powerful ascendant she had managed
to get over him during the seven years of their <i>liaison</i>.
But he wanted nothing better than to break with her. She
read it perfectly in his furtive glances, and in the gloomy
abstraction that weighed upon him, in his sudden, unnatural
cheerfulness, in his fear and servility which increased every
time he came near her. One evening the count asked for
a glass of water. A sudden light came into Amalia's
eyes&mdash;the longed-for moment had arrived. She pulled the
bell, and said in a peculiar tone to the maid who answered
it:<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></p>

<p>"Paula, send a glass of water."</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards Josefina came in, poorly clad,
with a little coarse linen apron, and shod with rough shoes.
Her little hands had difficulty in carrying a tray with water,
and sugar, and sugar-tongs. The guests were astounded,
and Luis turned pale. The child advanced to the middle
of the room looking timidly at her godmother, who signed
to her to go to the count. The count staggered as if he
had had a blow, but seeing the little creature standing before
him, he hastened to take the glass, and raised it with trembling
hand to his lips. Amalia's eyes meanwhile looked
cold and indifferent, but the imperceptible trembling of her
lips betrayed the cruel delight she was feeling. A significant
silence pervaded the gathering whilst this scene was
being enacted.</p>

<p>Directly Josefina had left, the Señora de Quiñones explained
this change to her guests with perfect naturalness.
Some punishment had been found necessary for the arrogance
that the child had taken to showing towards the
servants. It would not be for long. Nevertheless, it was a
daily struggle with the will of Quiñones, who objected to
her being brought up with so much indulgence.</p>

<p>"The fact is," she concluded in a tone so natural that it
would have reflected credit on an actress&mdash;"the fact is,
sometimes I am obliged to put her in her place in my
house. What good is it to raise her to a position she
cannot maintain? Any day we may die, and the poor
thing will have to support herself by work, if she does not
find a husband before then. And what husband would take
a girl with many requirements, and no money?"</p>

<p>The guests were not deceived. She really did not
expect that they would be. All that was a pure sop to
conventionality, but nobody was deceived as to the real
facts. The count left soon after, being unable to control
his vexation.</p>

<p>"This business of Luis is not going on very well," said<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>
Manuel Antonio to a little party going home by the Calle
de Altavilla consisting of Maria Josefa, the Pensioner, and
his daughter Jovita. "If ever the marriage of Fernanda
does come to anything, it will be at the cost of much unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Maria Josefa, to draw him out.</p>

<p>"<i>Madre!</i> Are you mad, woman? Don't you know
Amalia as well as I do?"</p>

<p>"And what has Amalia to do with Luis' marriage?"
asked Jovita, to whose maidenhood simplicity seemed
befitting in spite of her two-and-thirty years.</p>

<p>"Ay! It is true there is this little girl here," exclaimed
the Chatterbox with comic, mocking gestures. "I did not
think of that! Nothing, nothing, little monkey; go on in
front, these are matters for grown-up people."</p>

<p>The Pensioner's daughter was pricked to the quick at this
remark and made an insolent retort. Manuel Antonio
repaid it with another, and a regular quarrel was started, in
which bitter pointed words were banded and it lasted as far
as the house of the Pensioner, who had made fruitless efforts
to re-establish peace between them. As usual, the Chatterbox
got the best of it, for his remarks combined the vigour
of a male with the subtle spite of a female.</p>

<p>The next day the count had an interview with Amalia in
which he expressed his vexation at the scene of the preceding
evening. The lady was amiable and condescending,
and justified her conduct by its being for the welfare of the
child. But Luis noticed that she spoke in a peculiar manner,
and he detected a tone of bitterness and irony in her
words that astonished him. He left her in a preoccupied
and uneasy frame of mind, and for some days he could not
shake off the unpleasant impression of the interview. But
his love was rapidly taking possession of every corner of his
soul and finally conquered even that preoccupation. He
was profoundly in love. And as it always happens his
timidity increased in proportion to his love. At first he<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>
seemed serene and courteous in his long conversations with
Fernanda, losing no opportunity of demonstrating his admiration
and devotion to his <i>ex-fiancée</i>. But he suddenly
lost his <i>aplomb</i>, and he shunned all reference to his
own feelings; and he avoided all gallant remarks, but Fernanda
was not deceived. This love had at last come after
the lapse of all that time. Ah! how many tears it had cost
her!</p>

<p>Although their conversations were on commonplace subjects,
they had a delicate, exquisite savour. They talked for
hours and hours without being tired, and for the pleasure of
being near to, and listening to, each other. Fernanda
chatted in all the joy of her heart without minding the
timidity of her adorer, and with the enjoyment of seeing
the puerile pains he took to avoid his confession of love,
knowing that she could have him at her feet directly
she gave the sign. The moment came at last. One day
the beautiful widow determined to declare herself. They
were talking of marriage and second marriages. Luis
began to get excited, and to give his opinion in a
trembling voice, trying to change the conversation.
Suddenly Fernanda said with perfect calmness and in a
determined tone:</p>

<p>"I shall not marry a second time."</p>

<p>He turned pale. His face became so sad that the girl,
repressing a smile with difficulty, repeated the remark with
still greater decision:</p>

<p>"I shall not be led into a second marriage&mdash;unless it be
with you."</p>

<p>The count gazed at her in delight.</p>

<p>"Is it really so?" he finally asked, in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is really so!" she returned, looking at him with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Fernanda."</p>

<p>"Take it, Luis."</p>

<p>They held each other's hands affectionately for some<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>
moments. Then the count rose without saying another
word. When he arrived home he wrote her a long letter of
six pages, describing his passion in the most glowing
colours, giving her fervent thanks, and three or four times
calling himself an unworthy fellow. The marriage was
arranged to take place at the end of the year of mourning,
of which there were still two months to run. They
decided to keep the matter secret, and not to have the
ceremony in Lancia. A few days before the wedding-day
she was to go to Madrid, where he would join her, and
there at the capital they were to be united for ever.</p>

<p>It is very difficult in little towns to hide anything, and to
conceal a projected marriage is impossible. Every pair of
eyes and every pair of ears seemed magnified to a hundred,
so intensely were sight and hearing concentrated on the
couple. By their gait, looks, and manner of greeting, and
leaving each other, the ingenious Lancians guessed by
veritable magic of what the couple was thinking, and they
calculated exactly the progress of the affair that excited
such interest in them.</p>

<p>As Manuel Antonio was passing the old-world dwelling
of the count, he saw a maid come out with a cardboard
box in her hand. The Chatterbox at once scented a wedding,
so he took breath and followed her.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Laura?" he said, passing her. Then
turning quickly, he said in a careless sort of way:</p>

<p>"How is your master?"</p>

<p>"The señor is not ill."</p>

<p>"Ah! But I was told&mdash;well, have not seen
him for two days. Are you going shopping for the
señora?"</p>

<p>"They are shirts for the señor conde."</p>

<p>"From Ramiro's? Let me see them, as I have to get
some too."</p>

<p>The maid opened the box, and the Chatterbox examined
the contents.<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></p>

<p>"They are very fine; they would be too dear for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, señor, they are dear, and yet the señor does not
think they are good enough. He wants them of silk, at
whatever cost, and although I have been to every shop I
can't get them. There is nothing for it but to order them."</p>

<p>"Of silk? <i>Madre!</i> Then he is going to be married!"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, señorito," the maid hurriedly
replied, with signs of confusion.</p>

<p>"Get along, little hypocrite!" he returned, laughing;
"you know as well as I do, as well as everybody. And
when is it to be?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I know nothing."</p>

<p>But the Chatterbox insisted so much, and was so eloquent
and familiar, that after some time the servant let out what
she knew.</p>

<p>"But look here, I cannot tell you anything for certain of
what is going on, but I think he will marry shortly, from
some remarks I heard the other day of the señora
countess."</p>

<p>"What remarks?"</p>

<p>"She said to the housekeeper that when her son married
she would go for a time to the Grange, and afterwards,
looking through the keyhole, I saw her crying. Then Fray
Diego was in the house the day before yesterday&mdash;but I
don't know whether I ought to say."</p>

<p>"Get along, woman; what does it matter. Do you
think I am a gossip?"</p>

<p>"Well, I heard him say when he was leaving: 'No, no,
they are quite right, it is much better for them to do it in
Madrid. This is a very spiteful place.'"</p>

<p>The pleasure that Columbus felt at the discovery of the
New World was nothing in comparison to that of our
Chatterbox. He not only knew without any kind of doubt,
that they were going to be married, but he had ascertained
where the ceremony was to take place. Overwhelmed with
such splendid news, and wishing to pour it forth to some<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>body, he stopped to consider where it would have the most
effect. His thoughts went straight to Amalia; so to the
Palace of Quiñones he directed his mincing little steps.</p>

<p>It was the hour of twilight. The señora was sitting in
her boudoir, doubtless absorbed in one of those intense,
mournful meditations to which she had for some time
been a prey. Manuel Antonio was jovial and chatty, and
set about cheering her up as much as possible, making the
blood circulate with renewed energy in that ulcerated heart,
so that the shock should be more painful when it came.
He asked for chocolate, and they took it together with
pleasant conversation. Amalia seemed to forget her worries,
and when she was just becoming quite cheerful, zas! the
bomb fell. But it fell gently, with that infinite art known
only to men endowed with a feminine mind.</p>

<p>The only thing he regretted was not being able to see
her face. The room was almost dark. But he was quite
conscious of the gravity of the explosion by the sound of
her voice and the coldness of her hand as she bade him
good-bye. Amalia remained standing for a long time,
rigid and motionless. She leaned against the heavy curtain
to look into the street, and measured the height of the drop.
She tried to open her desk to get a bottle of essence, but
she turned the key too roughly and hampered the lock.
Then she left the room and wandered about the dark
passages and staircase in a vague, uncertain way like a
phantom. Then, far away, she saw a point of light, and
involuntarily made her way to it like a moth.</p>

<p>It was the dining-room, and seated at the table playing with
some little clay shepherdesses, the remains of past possessions,
was Josefina. The shade of the lamp concentrated a bright
light upon the little head, round and yellow as an orange.
Amalia stopped an instant and looked at her with an ardent
gaze, devouring that grave melancholy face which bore such
a striking resemblance to Luis. She made a step, and the
child turned her head. The expression of her blue eyes was<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>
equally sweet and sad, and the movement of her eyelashes
the same. The wife of the Grandee covered the distance
between them with two steps, and fell upon her like a
hungry tiger. She struck, bit, and tore her, and that open
face soon bore large purple marks from her hands, and
blood began to flow. The child, mad with fear, uttered
piercing cries. She had scarcely had time to see her godmother,
and she did not know what had happened. Amalia,
insatiable, went on striking and hurting. The cries of the
victim increased her fury; at last she paused.</p>

<p>"Godmother, what are you doing?" exclaimed the poor
child, running into a corner.</p>

<p>This question, and the look of anguish which accompanied
it, infuriated the lady afresh, and she beat her again unmercifully.
The little creature covered her face with her hands.
Then she caught her by the ears and nearly dragged them off.
Not satisfied with that, and angry at not being able to hurt
her face, she took up a feather broom that was on the table,
and hit her sharply on the hands with the handle, leaving
them black and blue. At last the child managed to escape.
The servants who had gathered to witness the scene with
astonishment, let her pass and run down the passages to
the staircase. The street door was open. The coachman
on taking the horses to water, had left it so. Josefina went
out of the house, fled down the street of Santa Lucia, passed
under the archway of Santa Barbara, crossed the Archbishop's
Square and so to the gate of San Joaquin, to the Sarrió
Road.</p>

<p>Evening had closed in. A fine but very fast rain was
falling, which soon made her wet to the bones. The
wretched little creature ran for some time, and at last
stopped from sheer fatigue. The side wall of the road
being low at that part, she sat down, and then began to feel
the pain from the blows. She put her hands to her head,
then to her face, from which she felt a hot liquid pouring
that she thought at first was rain. She soon saw it was<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>
blood. Blood! the thing in all the world of which she had
the greatest fear! Still a prey to terror, she did not moan.
She took a fold of her little frock and dried herself, or
rather she washed her face, for the frock was wet; but
what she felt most, and what hurt her in a horrible way,
were her hands. Not knowing what to do to alleviate the
pain she began to blow on them. Then she sucked them.
But the pain was so intense that at last she exclaimed,
sobbing:</p>

<p>"Oh! my hands!"</p>

<p>At this moment there arose before her, amid the shadows
of the night, two enormous figures that froze her with horror.
One of them stooped down and took her by the arm.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he said, in a rough voice.<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class="head">THE BARON'S JUSTICE</p>


<p class="nind">I<span class="smcap">n</span> a large room in the dreary house of the los Oscos,
furnished with four old pieces of furniture, and carpeted with
two inches of dust, two of our acquaintances in this story
were seated at an oak table. One was the baron, the master
of the house, the other, his friend Fray Diego. They had
an empty jar of gin before them, another half full, and some
drinking-cups.</p>

<p>Neither table-cloth, table-cover, nor tray were there.
The table was only covered with many-shaped stains of gin
and wine, which, in happy conjunction with the dust, had been
left during the course of years and months. The room is
dull because the Calle del Pozo is dull, and the dirty
window-panes have not been cleaned for years, and the
evening is closing in.</p>

<p>By the little light that penetrated, it could be seen that
the faces of both men were excessively red, so red that it
seemed wonderful that blood did not burst from their
bloodshot eyes. The baron had arrived at the apotheosis
of fiery and fearful ugliness. The crimson scar across his
cheek stood out so sharp and black with corrugations, that
it was fearful to see it. His fierce, waxed moustache was
more white than black. He was dressed in black sheep
skin, and he had a red flat cap on his head, of which the
great tassel fell sometimes over his ears and sometimes
over his nose, according to the movement of the ogre-like
body. They were silent for some time. Fray Diego occa<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>sionally
raised his hand to the bottle of gin, filled his friend's
glass, then his own, which he gravely drank at one draught.
The baron was not so quick; he took his glass, raised it to
the level of his eyes, and made a series of faces at it, which
were sometimes horrible to witness. Then he touched it
with the edge of his lips, made faces again, touched it
again, and finally, after many attempts and vacillations,
decided to swallow it. It was in this grave, quiet way that
the two old soldiers spent nearly every evening of the
year. The town knew it, and it was a subject of bets with
the jocose inhabitants which of the two would die first
from apoplexy. Fray Diego had served in the ranks of
the Pretender. Then he became a friar and went to the
Philippines, and finally he left the monastic rule, and
lived in Lancia as an independent priest. They had not
known each other during the war, but when they came
to Lancia they became united with indissoluble ties of
friendship by their ideas being the same, by the recollection
of the glorious battles in which they had taken part&mdash;and
by the gin.</p>

<p>"Long live the Pope, the head of all the kings of the
earth!" exclaimed Fray Diego after a long silence, in
which they both appeared to be asleep. At the same time
he gave a great thump to the table which made all the
glasses and bottles ring.</p>

<p>The baron took hardly any notice. He went on winking
at the glass he had before him, and after swallowing the
contents very leisurely, and licking his lips three or four
times, he said:</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, Fray Diego! You don't know what the
Popes are."</p>

<p>"Long live the Pope, the head of all the kings of the
earth!" repeated the cleric, giving a still louder thump upon
the table.</p>

<p>"Take care, Fray Diego! The Popes have always been
very ambitious."<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></p>

<p>"Señor baron!" exclaimed the priest in a voice so
emphatic as to be comic; "you have a soul as ugly as your
face!"</p>

<p>The baron was unmoved at the insult, and after a time
he said, with perfect tranquillity:</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool. What has my face to do with the
matter? I am catholic, apostolic, Roman; but if to-morrow
the king our señor" (here he raised his hand to his cap)
"were to send me with a detachment to Rome, I would go
like the Constable of Bourbon, sack it, and take the
Pope."</p>

<p>"And I say that if his Holiness sent me to put a
bayonet through the stomach of that constable, you may be
sure I would put two."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How no?" roared the chaplain, getting in a rage.</p>

<p>"Because the constable died three centuries ago."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it, for he has then been burning three
centuries in hell."</p>

<p>"All this is very well, <i>Pater</i>, but the king is always to the
fore, and others have only to be silent and obey."</p>

<p>"The Pope is never silent, señor baron."</p>

<p>"Then he must be gagged."</p>

<p>"I should like to see it done! Presumption! presumption!
a hundred times presumption! Who would dare to
do it if Fray Diego de Areces were near?" cried the cleric
convulsed with rage, and jumping up, whilst his eyes blazed
with fury.</p>

<p>"Sit down, <i>Pater</i>, and calm yourself, and take another
glass, for Fray Diego de Areces is only a common
vessel."</p>

<p>The chaplain instantly calmed down, delicately poured
out the liquor into the two glasses, and swallowed his own
share with pleasure, after which his head fell on his breast,
his eyelids dropped, and he was asleep. The baron, radiant
with delight, looked at him sharply with cunning eyes, then,<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>
profiling by his companion's temporary obliviousness, he
took another glass, saying, "The nones."</p>

<p>It was a peculiar feature of those delightful sessions that
the gin changed the character of both. The irascible,
impetuous temper of the baron was softened in a remarkable
way whilst the beneficial effects of alcohol lasted. He
was cheerful, communicative, conciliatory, nobody's remarks
upset him, nothing seemed worth getting angry about. Fray
Diego, on the contrary, who, in his normal condition, was
always a jovial, jocose priest, turned into a very devil for
disputing and nagging, and he betrayed a combative disposition
that nobody would have suspected under his round,
placid face and pious calling.</p>

<p>He roused himself at the end of a few minutes, looked at
the baron fixedly for some moments with strange ferocity,
and said stammeringly:</p>

<p>"Will the señor baron kindly explain to me what he
means by a common vessel?"</p>

<p>"Come, I've done with that. Are we to go on about
that? What does it signify to you what the one or the
other means?"</p>

<p>"Because I choose to know; we must understand one
another."</p>

<p>"We have understood each other. You have two pints
of gin inside you and I another two, or perhaps more," he
added, with several winks.</p>

<p>"It is not so, señor baron, it is not so! We must understand
each other once for all, stupid!"</p>

<p>"Here there are no barons and no priests," exclaimed
the noble in an excess of good humour, jumping up from
his seat. "Here we are only Uncle Francisco&mdash;that is I,
and Uncle Diego, that is you&mdash;are we not? Your hand
upon it."</p>

<p>Advancing with his hand extended he staggered, but
kept his feet.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, my brave fellow!"<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></p>

<p>The cleric was pacified, and they shook hands.</p>

<p>"Now an embrace for the legitimate King of Spain."</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me of embraces," cried the priest, again
getting angry. "I recollect Vergarra's embrace, fool!"</p>

<p>"Don't bother yourself, my friend, for we shall pay him
out.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ay, ay, ay! mutila<br />
Chaplen gorria."<br />
</p>

<p>And he began to sing the Carlist hymn in a hoarse voice,
but soon interrupting himself, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Diego, sing! Give over tears now!"</p>

<p>His friend was in fact shedding great tears as he recalled
the treachery of Vergarra.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, soldier! A drink to the extermination of
the negroes would not come amiss."</p>

<p>Fray Diego admitted by a movement of his head that he
would willingly be a party to this consolatory toast, but he
did not move from his seat. They quaffed another glass,
and the effect upon the emotional soul of the baron was so
marvellous, that immediately he began dancing an English
breakdown on the table, which did not stop Fray Diego's
copious flow of tears.</p>

<p>"Hum! I don't care for this foreign dance," he observed
at last with a final jump. "I prefer the <i>danza prima</i>.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> Come
here, Uncle Diego."</p>

<p>Whereupon he took the priest by force by both hands,
dragged him from his chair, and made some turns with him,
intoning one of the long monotonous songs of the country.
Fray Diego felt rejuvenated as he was reminded of the
spring-time of his life in the country, when his uncle, the
Curé of Areces, thrashed him well for getting out of the
window by night to pay court to the girls of the neighbouring
villages.</p>

<p>"Listen, Diego," said the baron stopping suddenly.<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>
"Don't you think before we go on we had better drink a
glass to the souls of our betters?"</p>

<p>The priest willingly assented, but the glasses and the
empty bottles were rolling on the ground. The baron
opened a cupboard and drew from thence fresh elements
of spiritual life. This funereal glass inspired him with the
happy idea of covering the chaplain's head with his own
flat cap and adorning his own with the other's shovel-hat
which was lying upon a chair. So clad they went on dancing,
making a very remarkable pair. But the baron slipped
and fell.</p>

<p>"Help me up, Uncle Diego."</p>

<p>The priest took him by his outstretched hands and
pulled him up. But the weight of the noble was too much
for him, and they both rolled on the ground together.</p>

<p>"Rise, Uncle Diego!"</p>

<p>"Up, Uncle Francisco!"</p>

<p>They both rolled over with barbarous shouts of laughter.
At last the baron regained his footing. The cleric soon
followed his example. But his soul, which had been
momentarily illumined by the recollections of his youth,
suddenly reverted to blood and extermination. He turned
fiercely on his friend:</p>

<p>"Let us understand once for all, fool! Why did you call
me a common vessel just now? eh? eh? Why?"</p>

<p>"I will explain to you presently, man," returned the
baron calmly, "but we will drink first a toast to all faithful
Christians, whose visible head is the Pope&mdash;I say, if you
like."</p>

<p>The chaplain made no objection.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I called you a common vessel because a
common vessel you know is used for cooked potatoes."</p>

<p>So saying the baron fell into such a violent fit of merriment
that he very nearly choked. In the meanwhile the
prominent eyes of his comrade looked at him with such a
menacing expression that they nearly dropped from their<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>
sockets and fell upon him, as they visibly increased in size
like a locust's.</p>

<p>"And why cooked potatoes? I have as much courage
as you, fool! as I showed in the action of Orduña and
Unzá, and besides, I have six crosses at home."</p>

<p>"You? you?" said the gentleman, unable to resist a
smile. "You never served excepting at the mess of the
company."</p>

<p>The fury of the brother at hearing this was unbounded.
He halloed, he stamped, he thumped the table. Finally
he rushed to the door, from the threshold of which he
began to apostrophise his friend with excited gestures.</p>

<p>"You say this because you are in your own house!
Come out and say it here! Come out with me!"</p>

<p>The baron looked at him with smiling curiosity.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, calm yourself, Uncle Diego."</p>

<p>"Come out and fight with me! with sword, pistol, or what
you like."</p>

<p>"Very well, man, very well. We will come out and kill
each other; but it will only be to please you."</p>

<p>He then went with uncertain steps to the cupboard, and
with some difficulty, for it was now completely dark, he
put his hands into the press, and feeling about, drew forth
two large cavalry swords.</p>

<p>"Take one," he said, handing one to the chaplain.</p>

<p>Fray Diego drew it from its sheath and began to fence
with it. Whilst making these experiments Don Francisco
regarded him with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Well, let us go," said the priest returning the weapon
to its sheath. "Quick, march."</p>

<p>And taking his shovel-hat that was lying on the floor, and
concealing the sword under his robes, he passed out of the
door. The baron caught up his cap, put on a heavy overcoat
and followed him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he exclaimed, before he had gone four steps.
"Don't you think that we have left some liquor behind?"<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></p>

<p>Fray Diego gave an affirmative grunt. They re-entered
the room, and feeling on the floor they came against the
jar of gin that was not completely empty. This they
poured into the glasses, and drank up all there was. Their
next act was to sally into the street. The rough-stoned
pavement was wet. A fine rain was falling, but it was so
thick that it penetrated clothing as much as a sharp shower.
Night had completely closed in; and as, according to the
municipal customs, it wanted a good half-hour before the
celebrated oil-lamps were lighted, darkness enveloped the
rain-driven town. The two heroes, animated by a warlike
spirit, perambulated the Calle del Pozo with determination,
the cleric before, the noble behind, both muffled up to the
eyes, each with the instrument of murder under his arm.
They entered the Calle de las Hogueras, passed under the
walls of the fortress and out by the road that runs by the
old wall of the town. As the water filtered through their
clothes, it refreshed their bodies, and partially equilibriated
their tempers. Fray Diego became visibly calmer, and the
black clouds of depression that oppressed him gradually
dispersed, but the baron's haughty, cruel spirit became
meanwhile a prey to the morbid conditions of the other.
But both facing the prospect of death pursued their intrepid
course through the night and rain. They went for some
distance by the old wall until they came to the Sarrió
road, which they took. They had not proceeded five
minutes along it when they heard a groan. They stopped
at once, and approaching the side-wall they caught sight of
a bundle, which, on coming nearer, they found to be a child.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" said the baron, seizing her
by the arm.</p>

<p>"Pardon!" exclaimed Josefina, overwhelmed with terror.
"For goodness' sake don't beat me, señor! I have already
been beaten so much."</p>

<p>The gentleman immediately loosened his hold, and
changing his voice and tone, said:<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></p>

<p>"No, my child, no; nobody shall beat you. How do
you come to be here at this hour?"</p>

<p>"My godmother has beaten me a good deal, and I ran
away from home."</p>

<p>"Have you not a father?"</p>

<p>"No, señor."</p>

<p>"Do you live in Lancia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, señor."</p>

<p>"Who is your godmother?"</p>

<p>"A lady."</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Amalia."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Fray Diego, striking his forehead
with his hand. "It is the adopted child of Don Pedro Quiñones."</p>

<p>"Is not Don Pedro the husband of your godmother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, señor."</p>

<p>"Come, get up, my child. You can't stay there. Come
with us."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, for God's sake! Don't take me to my godmother."</p>

<p>"No, we won't go there. You are wet, little creature,"
he added, touching her clothes. "Come, come."</p>

<p>The two heroes had meanwhile put their swords on the
wall, and when they went off to Lancia with the child
between them, they left them there regardless of the damp
tarnishing and rusting the steel.</p>

<p>"And why did your godmother beat you?" asked Fray
Diego as they walked slowly to accommodate their steps to
those of the child.</p>

<p>"Because I was playing with the sheep."</p>

<p>"The sheep! But do Don Pedro's sheep come and sleep
in the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, señor, they sleep in the cardboard box."</p>

<p>"Look here, child, what are you saying?" said the cleric
stopping.<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></p>

<p>When the inquiry led to the understanding that the
sheep were of clay, Fray Diego resumed his walk, protecting
the fragile form of the little creature with his long cloak.
But his hand happening to touch her face, he noticed
with surprise that the moisture on his fingers was warm.
He communicated this fact to the baron, and as they had
now reached the first houses of the town, they put the child
in a doorway, lighted a match and had a look at her. Her
whole face was bathed in blood and cut across with deep
gashes, whilst her hands were covered with bruises. The
heroes looked at each other in horror, and the same
wave of indignation inflamed their cheeks. The baron then
gave vent to a string of strong imprecations. These, and
his fearfully ugly face, made such an impression on Josefina,
that she fled crying to a corner. They managed with some
trouble to tranquillise her, and after drying her face with a
handkerchief, Fray Diego took her up in his arms (the
baron had attempted it in vain), covered her with his cloak,
and set off for the ancient house of the los Oscos.</p>

<p>Here they took her in hand. The baron, who had
attained some knowledge of surgery in the campaign,
carefully washed her wounds, closed them with plaister,
and dressed the contusions with a very efficacious ointment
that he had by him. The touch of the rough hands of
those veterans seemed as soft as velvet as they came in
contact with the child's skin. A woman could not have
tended her with more delicacy, attention, and devotion.</p>

<p>Josefina soon forgot her fears. That ugly gentleman was
not bad. She ventured to ask for water. The baron
replied that the best thing she could have to strengthen
her would be a glass of sherry. One was brought, and
whilst the child drank it, the two champions of the
legitimate king retired into a corner of the room to deliberate.</p>

<p>They decided that the thing to be done was to take the<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>
child to the house of the Quiñones. The baron undertook
to take the little creature back, and then he would tell her
godmother what he thought of her; he would tell her she
was an infamous woman, a vile, perverse creature, and if she
dared ill-treat the poor helpless child again, he would go to
her house, slit her ears, and then tie her by the hair to the
tail of his horse, and so drag her through the town. Fray
Diego did not agree to so much cruelty, but the baron
declared that nothing would induce him to swerve from his
sinister plan of making a terrible example of her.</p>

<p>It cost some trouble to make Josefina go with them.
They only managed it by promising she should not be
beaten again, and that in truth her godmother would be
very kind to her for the future. That was all she wanted!
And they added that if she dared touch a hair of her head,
lightning of God! he would wring her neck like a
chicken's! and would give her a sound whipping with his
horse's bridle. And the countenance of that gentleman
was so fearful as he uttered these threats that the child
never doubted for an instant that they would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Whilst making their way to the house of the Quiñones,
the baron continued to break out into insulting expressions
and threats of murder against the wife of the Grandee.
Fray Diego made futile attempts to calm him. But his
murderous feelings had so got the upper hand, that the ex-Brother,
fearing a catastrophe, left him at the door of the
palace. The baron pulled the bell. As he was not acquainted
with the feudal custom of the house, he did not
pull more than once, so, as he was thought to be a
plebeian, the door was not opened immediately. The
surprise of the servant was great when he saw that
terrible señor, who inspired such respect in the town, and
he hastened to ask pardon for not having admitted him
more promptly. The baron asked for Don Pedro Quiñones.<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></p>

<p>He was requested to enter, and the servant preceded him
up the large stone staircase. On arriving at the first floor,
he was asked to wait whilst he was announced.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards Amalia appeared. She cast a
sharp, angry glance at the child, whom the baron held by
the hand, and turning to the gentleman she said in a cold,
haughty tone:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I came to bring this child that I found in the street&mdash;and
at the same time to have a few words with Don Pedro
or with you."</p>

<p>With this last remark the baron's voice perceptibly
changed.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me?" he added, seeing that the lady
looked at him fixedly without replying.</p>

<p>In little places everybody knows everybody, especially
persons of position, although they may not be intimate with
them, but Amalia replied in a barefaced manner:</p>

<p>"I have not that honour."</p>

<p>"I am the baron de los Oscos."</p>

<p>The lady bowed.</p>

<p>"Paula," she said, turning to a servant who had entered,
"take this child. And Pepe, light the lamps in the blue
room."</p>

<p>"Señora," began the baron, "I found this child in the
Sarrió road, covered with blood and contusions. I asked
her who had brought her to that pass, and she told me that
it was her godmother. I cannot believe it."</p>

<p>"Then you can believe it, for it is true," said Amalia
interrupting him.</p>

<p>The baron stopped speechless and confused. Then he
continued:</p>

<p>"It is possible that you had some reason for punishing
her, but I am deeply sorry."</p>

<p>Here Amalia again interrupted him:</p>

<p>"And I am sorry that you are sorry."<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></p>

<p>"My object in coming here," said the baron, who was fast
losing his aplomb, "was to warn you, was to beg you&mdash;as I
have been told you have had the charity to take this
foundling&mdash;to continue the good work by protecting, sheltering
and educating her, and when it is necessary to punish
her will you do so with kindness, for the poor little creature
is delicate and weak, and the blows might put an end to
her life."</p>

<p>"Is this all you have to say to me?" asked the lady,
coldly.</p>

<p>The dreadful face of the baron contorted suddenly on
hearing this question; his eyes flashed, the deep wound
stood out on his face by reason, no doubt, of his great
internal emotion. Formidable sounds were heard in his
throat, low rumblings presaged a coming storm. But those
noises finally calmed down, the signs of disturbance ceased,
and instead of the crater giving forth, as it was feared, a
stream of burning lava, rocks, and ashes, it only weakly
emitted the two words:</p>

<p>"Yes, señora."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I take this opportunity of bidding you
welcome to the house in the name of Quiñones and
myself."</p>

<p>At the same time she pulled the bell rope and rose from
her seat. The baron also rose muttering words of thanks
and proffers of service.</p>

<p>"Pepe, take the señor baron down."</p>

<p>He made a profound reverence, which Amalia returned in
a lesser degree, and the gentleman turned on his heels and
left. As he descended the staircase quite nonplussed, his
face on fire, and his eyes aflame, it was a great relief to
think of the drawing and quartering, the loss of eyes, the
horse's tail and other fearful punishments of the Visigoth
epoch, to which the señora belonged by virtue of her
barbarous behaviour and her cruel, arrogant spirit.<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class="head">THE MARTYRDOM</p>


<p class="nind">S<span class="smcap">carcely</span> had the door been shut behind the baron when
Amalia had the child brought into her presence.</p>

<p>"Come here, señorita, come here! We have not seen
each other for some time! How have you spent it? Have
you got on well? The baron is very gallant with ladies, is
he not?"</p>

<p>The child uttered a sharp cry.</p>

<p>"Oh! my ear!"</p>

<p>"Go on your knees, you grub! Ah! Then does all I have
done for you count for nothing? Are you going to show
your teeth before you have finished sucking? On your
knees, you little rogue! You bad girl!"</p>

<p>Josefina fell in a heap in a corner of the room. Amalia
kept her burning gaze fixed upon her for some time. At last,
removing her eyes from her, she asked Concha and Paula,
who had brought the child in, how she came to escape.
The coachman was to blame. Then ensued strong language
against the coachman, who was said to be drunk, and with
threats of his dismissal if such an act of carelessness occurred
again. Then followed many remarks upon the baron's
appearance. What was that brute doing at such an hour in
the Sarrió road? Who was the cleric who was with him?
After these came a very sad survey of the ingratitude and
naughtiness of the child who fled from the house which had
given her shelter and made her protectors a laughing-stock.
The servants agreed that she deserved a very sharp punish<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>ment.
The lady then dismissed them, and stopped them with
an imperious gesture when they were going to take the child.
Once alone, Amalia took a book and began to read
quietly by the light of a lamp, whilst the child, on its knees
in the darkest corner, sobbed bitterly. Three or four
times she raised her head and darted an angry glance at
the dark corner, expecting a louder groan from the child so
that she could spring upon her. An hour went by&mdash;an
hour and a half. At last she shut the book, went out, and
returned in a few minutes. She began slowly to undress.
When half undressed she took the lamp, and approaching
the child, obliged her to get up, when she conducted her to
the bed, and showing her the floor, she said:</p>

<p>"This is your bed. You will sleep here in your clothes."</p>

<p>When she had finished undressing, the child said in a weak
voice:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, godmother, I won't do it again."</p>

<p>But these words fell on deaf ears, and she got into bed
and put out the light.</p>

<p>Her eyes remained open in the darkness. The hours
chiming their quarters and their halves in a melancholy tone
from the clock of the neighbouring cathedral did not close
them. They were like two mysterious lamps, only giving
light within as they illuminated a thousand sinister and
tormenting ideas. Dark thoughts and fierce desires crowded
and pressed under that low forehead. She considered the
marriage of Luis an abominable treachery. Without recollecting
her own want of honour towards the poor old
paralysed man God had given her for a husband, nor
thinking how her sin had spoilt the life of the count,
threatened to die in solitude, without family ties to cheer
his latter days, she made him entirely accountable for the
wrong, and for all the bitterness she was now feeling in
losing the only pleasure that had brightened her gloomy,
monotonous existence. The only pleasure. Her love did
not deserve any other name. In that ardent, despotic,<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>
restless spirit there had never been a question of tenderness.
She was completely ignorant of the delicious, poetic thoughts
that ennoble a passion and make it pardonable. Her life
had been passed in insane excitement, tormented by the
idea of being happy at all costs. She had lived for the
last seven years under the sway of her licentious, insatiable
passion. Never did a melancholy thought of remorse bear
witness in that depravity to a single moral sentiment. Her
thirst for pleasure drove her into a thousand extravagant
and dangerous courses. She was not contented with
gathering under her roof all the youth of Lancia and
dancing occasionally as a condescension, but she required
for her enjoyment company every day, picnics, masquerades,
&amp;c., and she liked to dance until she nearly fell with exhaustion,
like a country lass of fifteen summers. She found
it necessary to contrive secret interviews with her lover
at most extraordinary hours, and on most unheard of
occasions. Her ungovernable passion led her to defy
public opinion, and delight in making light of precaution.
If the count gave her a word of warning, she flew into a rage.
She lost more than he did. Slander never hurts the man,
but only the woman, who has to bear all the disgrace. But
she went into fits of laughter at the thoughts of slander or
disgrace. If she were at all put out, she was quite capable
of proclaiming her sin in Altavilla when there was a gathering
of people. The count got more and more alienated from
this woman, who upset all his moral, theological, and social
ideas, and finally inspired him with dread. This turned to
terror and insufferable foreboding, that made him long for
his liberty, especially after Amalia smilingly made a certain
revelation to him.</p>

<p>"Do you know, dear," she said, "I nearly did such a mad
thing this morning. Quiñones sent me to pour out his
drops of arsenic that he has taken for some time. I took
up the bottle quickly and, as if pushed by the elbow by an
invisible hand, I poured half of the contents into the glass.<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>
Don't tremble, coward, for there was no motive in the
matter. I never felt anything like it. I swear to you that
my will was not party to it. I was controlled by a superior
will which strove to overpower mine. I put the glass upon
the table, looked at it for an instant, and held it up to the
light. There was nothing, not the slightest sign to denote
that it was an instrument of death. I put it on the tray
and walked with it towards the library without considering
what I was doing. But suddenly in the passage I came to
myself like awakening from a nightmare. I suddenly saw
the blunder I was going to make, and I let the glass fall on
the ground."</p>

<p>"It was not a blunder, it was a horrible crime you were
about to commit," said the count angrily, as a sweat of
horror came over him.</p>

<p>"Very well, crime or blunder, or whatever it was, it was
stupid in every way, you know, for one would see by the
symptoms that it was a question of poison."</p>

<p>Those words, uttered in a tone of assumed levity, made
more impression on the count than any former ones, and
henceforth he could not go near her without experiencing a
strange feeling of repugnance.</p>

<p>Her youth passed, but she paid no attention to the fact
until the arrival of Fernanda. Having no rivals in Lancia,
her carelessness of her personal appearance daily increased,
and she completely lost the subtle coquetry by which
women perpetuate the charm of their person. It was only
the sight of the splendid beauty of the daughter of Estrada-Rosa
that made her give a thought to herself. She then
began to think about the adornment of herself. She
procured all kinds of cosmetics, she sent for dresses to
Madrid, and availed herself of all the arts of elegance. It
was late. That miserable, neglected body, worn out by
years and ill-health, could not regain its freshness and
grace.</p>

<p>This <i>idée fixe</i> corroded her brain during her long,<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>
wretched vigil. No longer to inspire love! To be old,
and an object of repugnance! Her mind was torn with a
thousand fears. Luis was marrying. Why? Had she not
sacrificed to him her youth, honour, and salvation, if there
was anything after this life but the infernal regions?</p>

<p>What was the good of it? At the first sign of decay in
her face all his promises had vanished like a dream; the
seven years of love had disappeared in the abyss of time
without leaving the most insignificant sign. But she had
not wrinkles yet; she was not so old&mdash;five-and-thirty,
not more. She suddenly put her hand on the table by
her side, lighted the candle, and jumped out of bed.
She went to the looking-glass and looked at herself
for some time, passing her fingers over the surface of her
face to ascertain that the much-feared wrinkles were not
there.</p>

<p>A groan from behind made her turn her head. She
raised the candle and fixed an angry glance upon the child,
stretched upon the ground, trembling with fear. The child
could not sleep. Her feverish eyes looked at her anxiously,
her lips again murmured: "Pardon."</p>

<p>Without paying her any attention, the wife of Don Pedro
went back to bed and put out the light. The rays of
the morning sun, as they penetrated the room, fell
upon the two sleepless beings. With God's daylight
commenced the barbarous torture of an innocent creature.</p>

<p>Her fertile, diabolical imagination set to inventing
torments with which to feed the hate which consumed her.
The sight of suffering was a necessity to her. Josefina was
sent down barefooted with a pencilled note to Concha.
The missive said: "Concha, I send you this little rogue.
Punish her as you think fit."</p>

<p>Amalia knew what an executioner the maid would be,
and, in fact, she expressed satisfaction at receiving this note,
which flattered her vanity and her instincts.<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></p>

<p>"Do you know what this paper says?" she asked, in an
aggressive tone.</p>

<p>Josefina made a negative sign. She read writing badly,
especially when written as carelessly as that of the señora.
The sempstress, however, made her spell out the words
until she quite understood them.</p>

<p>"There, you see, you are sent for me to punish you for
what you did yesterday."</p>

<p>On saying this she smiled sweetly, as if she were saying
that she had something nice to give her.</p>

<p>The child looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"Punish me? Godmother has already made me sleep
on the floor."</p>

<p>"It does not matter, that is very little for such naughtiness
as running away from home. You will have to have a
whipping. I am sorry, my child, because you have never
had this punishment, and it will hurt you very much.
Young ladies have delicate flesh; they are not like us who
are accustomed as babies to intemperance and blows.
Come along!"</p>

<p>At the same time she drew from her stays one of the
formidable whalebones then in vogue.</p>

<p>The child drew back in alarm, but the needlewoman
caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Don't think of escaping, for then you will come in for a
double share."</p>

<p>Josefina seized her hand, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"Don't beat me, for God's sake, Concha! You know my
godmother beat me yesterday. Look, look at my hands.
My head also hurts me. The ground was so hard. I love
you very much. I have never blamed you to godmother."</p>

<p>"Silence! silence!" returned the sempstress, trying to
disengage herself gently from the little hands. "There is
nothing to be done but obedience. The señora gives the
order."<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></p>

<p>"No, por Dios! Concha, no, por Dios!" replied the
little creature between her sobs. "I love you very much,
and godmother too. If you don't beat me I will give you
my box of sheep."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Concha, mollified.</p>

<p>"Yes; now, directly, if you like."</p>

<p>"And your housewife?"</p>

<p>"That too."</p>

<p>"And the little cupboard with the mirror?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the little cupboard too."</p>

<p>Concha gave signs of giving in. The child looked at her
with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"And you promise always to be good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise always to be good."</p>

<p>"Never to run away again."</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, in an affectionate, condescending
tone; "then if you promise to be good, and you don't tell
the señora, and you give me all that you say, then&mdash;then&mdash;go
on child!"</p>

<p>And in one instant she pulled her clothes off and began
to beat her unmercifully, laughing like a mad woman with
delight.</p>

<p>The screams of the child reached the second floor. The
wife of the Grandee was standing before the glass arranging
her hair. She stopped. A singular shiver ran through her,
a certain indefinable, vague emotion like a tickling sensation
that one can't with certainty term pleasant or unpleasant.
Anyhow it was something that modified that insufferable
fever that the frenzy of rage had raised in her heart. She
stood motionless until the cries had ceased. Her eyes
shone, her pulse beat higher.</p>

<p>It is thus they say that the heart of a wild beast beats at
the sight of its victim. It was the commencement of the
child's martyrdom. Under the weakest pretexts she inflicted
the cruellest punishments, giving evidence of an<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>
imagination so fertile that it would have delighted the executioners
of the Holy office. Not only did she strike her for
the most innocent offences and pinch her and bite her,
but she delighted in keeping her in continual dread of
dreadful punishments, and so making her suffer day and
night. She made her go barefooted into the garden on the
coldest mornings to fetch her a flower, or she kept her
whole hours with her head in the sun to keep the birds
from picking at a currant bush. She made her sleep on the
ground by the side of her bed, when she sent her several
times down into the kitchen for water. She reduced her to
eating food she knew she did not like, and deprived her of
what she knew she liked.</p>

<p>As the days went by her madness and cruelty increased.
At first she made a pretext of some act of carelessness on
the part of the child to torment her. Afterwards she did
not stop there, but she did it when it came into her mind,
or when her physical state impelled her to do so. One
torture of her own invention was that of pricking her hands
with a needle, and she delighted in seeing them covered
with indentures in a few days, when there was scarcely room
to put another stab. She deputed this task to Concha, the
executioner of her orders, who fulfilled it most conscientiously.
She made her learn by heart long pieces of catechism
much beyond her power. And if she stumbled three
times, she said: "Go and ask Concha for a kiss."</p>

<p>This was the phase she had invented in derision for the
little creature to get a stab with the needle. She was never
allowed to change her underclothing, so the delicate skin of
the child soon became chafed, and she could not help
scratching herself. Whereupon Concha flew into a rage,
accused her of having the itch, and pushed her from the
room. It got worse and worse. The microscopic maid, at
the instigation of her mistress, insisted on her wearing boots
too small for her which made bad places on her feet and
caused her dreadful pain.<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></p>

<p>One of the most terrible tortures the child suffered was
when Amalia took it into her head she was not to cry.
Sometimes she let her sob and moan under the blows, and
she seemed to revel in the tears of the little creature, and in
hearing her piteous entreaties between the sobs; but occasionally
she insisted on her suffering in silence. As this
was impossible she became like a ravenous wild beast.</p>

<p>"Be silent!"</p>

<p>The child could not, and a groan escaped.</p>

<p>"Silence!" she repeated, accompanying the command
with several blows.</p>

<p>So Josefina tried to be silent, and made desperate efforts
in the attempt, but in spite of herself the difficult respiration
took the form of a groan. More blows.</p>

<p>"Silence, or I will kill you."</p>

<p>The little creature shut her mouth with all her might;
she turned livid, and sometimes she fell down senseless.
That tender heart was breaking from distress of mind.</p>

<p>At such moments Amalia experienced a diabolical sensation
of mingled pleasure and pain similar to that which is
felt in scratching a boil. Her boil was that violent passion&mdash;a
mixture of love, licentiousness and arrogance. Not being
able to vent upon her former lover the mortification which
tore her heart, she wreaked her vengeance on the fruit of
their love. When the child was bleeding and trembling at
her feet, her looks of anguish, her gestures, and the tone of
her voice seemed to her those of her lover, humiliated and
supplicating, and then she experienced an awful pleasure
which made her eyes shine and her nostrils dilate.</p>

<p>Josefina was a miniature likeness of Luis. When she had
been happy, her face mobile and smiling, and her eyes
shining with cheerfulness, it had not been so apparent; but
now misery and pain had given to her look a profound
melancholy, and to the lines of her face a certain expression
of fatigue that were the two things which characterised her
likeness to the Conde de Onis. When those beautiful blue<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>
eyes turned towards her in sweet resignation, when those
red lips trembled in asking pardon, the Valencian felt a
voluptuous feeling pervade her worn-out body, so that she
was reminded of the pleasures she had experienced in the
indulgence of her unlawful passion.</p>

<p>After all, she thought, she had not aged at all, in nothing
but the fading of that face of hers and her head producing
white hairs with such horrible rapidity. Her body,
her breast, her arms, her neck retained the same
alabaster hue, the same adorable brilliancy, the mark of a
fine and beautiful race. She touched herself in search of
consolation with feverish hands, and encountered the same
softness and freshness. That body had not worn out. She
still felt her own youth, the ardent circulation of her blood,
the thirst for enjoyment, and the yearning for the rapture
of love.</p>

<p>And yet all those delights were gone for ever; the novel
of her life that had embellished her dark existence of latter
years had come to the last chapter. She was an old
woman! It was a settled fact. At this thought that
branded itself on her brain as with a hot iron she felt overwhelmed
by an animal necessity to cry, roar, or tear. It
was at such times that the child underwent the cruellest
punishments, and her fragile existence incurred real danger.
Terror was another of the sufferings she frequently
inflicted on her. In the late hours of the night she made
her get up, and sent her to the most remote rooms of the
house in search of something. The child returned pale,
trembling, and overwhelmed with fear. Sometimes her
terror was so great that she let the candlestick fall, and
returned running and screaming with fright. Then Amalia,
enraged, pinched her and struck her, and pretended she
must go again to the place named. Then the little creature
let herself be tortured rather than expose herself afresh to
the same fright. On one of these occasions Amalia smiling
fiercely, said:<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></p>

<p>"Ah! So the señorita is so cowardly? Very well, I
must undertake to cure you of this weakness."</p>

<p>She recollected the extraordinary impressionability to
nocturnal terrors that Luis had confessed with shame in
moments of expansion. So she prepared dreadful alarms
for her. Sometimes she hid behind a door, and when she
was passing gave a loud cry as she seized her by the neck.
At other times she took a knife and said her death had
come, and told her to turn down her nightgown so that she
could cut her throat easier. But this last did not produce
as much effect as she expected. Josefina unconsciously
longed for death which would release her from such a
martyrdom. For a more efficacious cure of fear, Concha
and she invented a fearful practical joke which would have
been enough to terrify a brave man, much less a child six
years old. They both dressed themselves up in sheets, left
the room partially lighted whilst the child slept, put on
masks like skulls, and at midnight they came in uttering
fearful cries like souls from another world. When the little
creature awoke and saw those apparitions, she was paralysed
with terror, then she clapped her hands to her eyes and her
whole body was bathed in a cold perspiration. Her heart
beat so violently that it could be heard at a distance, she
gave vent to a few hoarse, terrified cries, and finally, putting
her hands to her breast, she fell senseless to the ground, a
prey to fearful convulsions.</p>

<p>Her timidity was incurable; and, moreover, she was
henceforth subject to faintings and to nocturnal frights.
She would wake up with signs of great fear, look fixedly
at one point in the room as if some apparition were there,
her heart beat violently, and her brow was bathed in
sweat. In such moments she completely lost consciousness.
Amalia called her in vain. It was only when she
put her hands upon her that she uttered a cry of fear and
sunk her head in terror.</p>

<p>Serious disputes arose between Concha and Maria the<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>
ironer on account of these tortures. Maria was naturally
compassionate, and she was sorry to see the martyrdom of
the child, although she did not know all, for Amalia took
care to keep it from the servants with the exception of
Concha. Although Maria was not ill-tongued she could
not abstain from blaming her mistress's conduct in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"My dear, it is worse than the Inquisition. It does not
seem that we are Christians, but Jewish dogs. At one time
so indulged that she was spoiled, and now suddenly the
little angel is treated worse than an animal. I say the
matter has gone beyond bounds! I cannot see such
wickedness."</p>

<p>"Silence, little fool and meddler," interposed Concha,
"who made you boss of the show? If the señora wishes
to teach the child what is right, is she to consult you how
to do it? Do you know what it is to bring up children?
If she has to be punished it is right it should be done by a
hardworking, honourable woman. Some day she will give
her thanks for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks, indeed! She will give them from the
cemetery. A month hence she will be gone."</p>

<p>"Very well, and what is that to do with you? Are you
her mother?"</p>

<p>They quarrelled three or four times like this, and the
dwarfish sempstress's shamelessness and evil-mindedness
always showed themselves.</p>

<p>At last being unable to endure such a spectacle with
patience, Maria determined to go away. One day she
went to the señora, and with the excuse that ironing was
bad for her, she asked for her wages. Amalia was quite
aware of the real reason, as she knew of her having complained
of her cruelty, but she dissimulated as usual:</p>

<p>"Yes, girl, I understand that ironing is tiring for you.
You don't enjoy much health. I also have not been well
for some days. To contend all one's life with sickness, and<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>
now at the end to have this child, on whom all my hopes
were founded, turn out so ungrateful and perverse! I
don't know how I have patience."</p>

<p>Maria hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, señora&mdash;children will be children."</p>

<p>The wife of the Grandee saw that if she pursued the
subject the ironer would say something disagreeable, so
she cut short the remark, paid her her wages, and dismissed
her affably.</p>

<p>This did not prevent the servant telling in confidence at
a certain house where she went in service what was going on
at the Quiñones. The news spread in the same confidence
from one to another, and in a short time there was a considerable
number of persons acquainted with the cruelties
perpetrated on the child.</p>

<p>The Conde de Onis, to avoid the curiosity of the public,
which worried him above all things, and also to be free of
Amalia, to whom he had told nothing, had removed about
a month ago to the Grange. He had not written to his
old love, although he thought of doing so every day to tell
her of his determination to marry. But so great was the
terror with which the Valencian inspired him, that the pen
fell from his hands every time he took it up to acquaint her
with the fact. He thus let the days go by in this continual
state of indecision, thinking with anxiety how enraged she
would be, and like all weak natures, hoping that some unforeseen
event would arrange a compromise. That way of
breaking the connection without any quarrel or explanation
whatsoever was quite in accordance with his character. He
knew nothing of his child's tortures, nevertheless he felt
such sudden anxiety when he thought of her that his nerves
were quite shaken, and he walked up and down the room
in visible agitation. The passionate love with which
Fernanda had inspired him had made him forget Josefina
a little. He occasionally thought of her with bitterness; he
thought that even if he married Fernanda, he would not<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>
attain happiness if he could not see his child every day;
although he quite understood that that would be impossible
whilst she remained in Amalia's power. Then he thought
of taking her away with him, and it gave him pleasure to
imagine wild projects of getting hold of her, and flying with
her and Fernanda to some remote and tranquil spot in the
world.</p>

<p>The count was going through one of these days of
vacillation when Micaela, the most excitable and violent of
the Pensioner's four undines, appeared at the Quiñones'
house. She came for the purpose of asking Amalia's advice
about a dress that she was planning for the next ball at the
Casino. In spite of her thirty years and more, she still
laid siege to the masculine sex. Visitors at this hour were
rare, but as the noble family of the Pensioner was so intimate
with the señora, the servant did not hesitate to show her up
to the boudoir where she was.</p>

<p>"How tiresome of me, is it not? But, dear, it is the
only time that I thought I should find you alone," she said,
with the gracious volubility that characterised the Mateo's
daughters.</p>

<p>Amalia received her cordially, albeit with a certain
surprise and uneasiness that escaped Micaela. They
entered on the matter in hand, and the question of dress
soon completely absorbed them. Amalia took her friend
towards the window. But they had not said many words,
when Micaela thought she heard a feeble groan in the room.
Turning her head, she saw in a corner Josefina on her
knees, tied by the elbows to the dressing-table so that she
could not get up without raising the heavy piece of furniture,
which was far beyond her strength. Amalia hastened to
give an explanation:</p>

<p>"This child is getting so naughty that I am obliged to
tie her to keep her quiet. Yesterday she bit the sewing-maid's
finger, now she has just broken a looking glass. One
has not patience to bear it!"<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></p>

<p>Micaela, who was shocked at the punishment, was silent.
The wife of Quiñones went on talking with assumed indifference
about the dress; but in spite of its being a theme
that ought to have interested her, the girl was absent-minded,
and cast frequent glances at the child. Josefina
let another groan escape, whereupon her godmother turned
round with ill-repressed anger.</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet? will you be quiet?" And she looked
at her for some time with extraordinary severity.</p>

<p>She returned to the conversation, but a slight change was
noticeable in her voice. Micaela paid less and less attention.
Indignation had risen to her throat, and she would
have ended by making some unpleasant remark to her
friend, if the child had not moaned again.</p>

<p>"Come, I see she is not going to leave us in peace,"
said the lady, making an effort to smile, "I shall have to
set her free."</p>

<p>Then she went and untied her, taking some time to do
it, for the cord was tied as many times round her little body
as if she were a heavy box. But when the time came for
the child to get up she could not. No doubt the muscles
had become strained during the hours she had been in that
painful position.</p>

<p>"Up, longshanks!" she said jokingly, as she helped her
to rise.</p>

<p>Micaela watched the scene in stupefaction, whilst her eyes
blazed with fury.</p>

<p>"You did not like the position, eh? Then, my child, if
you don't want to return to it, you must be good and
obedient. Is it not so, Micaela?"</p>

<p>But Micaela did not open her lips, feeling each moment
more brow-beaten in spite of the honeyed smile on the
Valencian's face.</p>

<p>"Very well," she continued, caressing the red face of the
child, "you are forgiven now, but take care about being
naughty. Go down and ask Concha for a kiss."<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></p>

<p>On hearing these words, the child grew deadly pale,
remained motionless for some moments, and finally went to
the door with an uncertain step. Before arriving there,
Micaela, who observed her attentively, noticed that she
raised her eyes full of tears, but Amalia merely pursued the
conversation on toilettes. Before three minutes had elapsed
low, distant cries of the child reached the boudoir. Micaela
was thunderstruck, and she bent her head towards the door
so as to hear better. But Amalia quickly rose from her
seat and went to shut it. The cries were still audible,
but the nervous girl had meanwhile to listen to Amalia's
remarks. She was seized with great uneasiness, her face
became flushed, and she was a prey to the burning desire
of shaming the wicked woman, and overwhelming her with
such opprobriums as Jew, scoundrel, infamous one. She
suddenly became aware of all that went on in that house.
First the jealousy, then the news of the marriage of Luis
falling like a bombshell, then the miserable revenge wreaked
on the child for the forsaking of the father. She well knew
the spiteful nature of the Valencian. But what good would
it do to insult her at that moment? It would only make a
great scene, and she would be sent from the house. In
spite of her violent temper, Micaela had a kind heart.
What she was most intent upon, was doing something to
help the unhappy little creature. And she had sufficient
self-control to dissimulate a little, and to consider that the
best course was to tell everything immediately to the count,
who must be ignorant of such cruel revenge. She finished
the interview as soon as possible, and took her leave without
being able entirely to hide her distress. Once in the
street, she felt the necessity of unburdening her heart.
She thought of Maria Josefa who lived in the neighbourhood,
and who professed such tender affection for the
foundling.</p>

<p>She entered her house agitated and trembling, and before<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>
uttering a single word, she fell on the sofa and fanned herself
with the end of her mantilla.</p>

<p>"Uf! I am suffocated. I don't know what has come to
me. She is an infamous creature&mdash;a wicked woman who
ought to burn in hell! I have always said so, only my fools
of sisters would not believe me. This choking is very tiresome....
She has a heart of stone!"</p>

<p>"But what is it?" asked the wise old maid with terror,
and dying of curiosity.</p>

<p>Then the nervous daughter of the Pensioner, stuttering
with rage, told her how she had found Josefina, the pallor
of the child at the curious suggestion of the godmother,
and then the cries she had heard as if she were being
tormented. Maria Josefa immediately united her imprecations
with those of the girl. Then they went over all the
instances of cruelty that they knew of the wife of the
Grandee, and they made up their minds to acquaint the
count with what had happened after ascertaining a few
more details. For this purpose they had that same afternoon
a talk with Maria, the laundry-maid, who had left the
Quiñones house some days ago. At first she was cautious
for fear of the consequences, but she concluded by letting
her tongue loose and recounting the thousand iniquities
perpetrated on the foundling by the Señora de Quiñones.
They were horrorstruck. They thought of telling the judge;
but besides making an enemy of the fiery Valencian (which
be it said to their credit they did not much mind for such a
cause) they knew that it would be a fruitless effort. The
Quiñones were the most important people of the place.
Don Pedro being the head of the Government Party in the
province, all the authorities were quite under his influence.
Everything would be covered up and remain as it was
before. The best thing was to appeal to the count; but
he was at the Grange just then. Besides, although everybody,
or nearly everybody, knew the secret of the child's<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>
birth, it was impossible to take it as a matter of course.
After some debates they decided to write him the following
letter, signed by Maria Josefa:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Señor Conde de Onis,&mdash;My esteemed friend, I beg, with
due reserve, to tell you that the child that was adopted by
our friends the Quiñones, in whom we are all so much
interested, is an object of cruel tortures in that house; and
I believe that it is our duty to intervene to stop it. You
will tell me what ought to be done, which I as a woman
would not think of. If you would like to hear particulars
of the martyrdom of the little creature you can refer to
Maria, who left service in Don Pedro's house some days ago.</p>

<p class="signature">Your affectionate friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Maria Josefa Hevia.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>Luis crumpled up the letter in his clenched hands, and
all the blood rushed to his face. Without thinking of what
he was doing he left the house, and almost unwittingly
took the road to Lancia, where he arrived in a few minutes.
The vague and terrible presentiment that had oppressed
him was finally realised&mdash;Amalia was revenging herself
cruelly. The underlying drift of the letter was evidently an
appeal to him, as the father of Josefina, and the cause of
her misery. Not knowing what course to take, he went to
think it over at his house, where he only had an old woman
in charge. From her he ascertained the whereabouts of
Maria, and finally sent her a message to come and see him.
The laundry-maid was quite aware of the object of the
summons. She went to the town as quickly as possible,
and after making him promise not to make use of her
name, she gave him a circumstantial account of what the
innocent child was exposed to. He listened, pale and
horrorstruck, unable to repress the violent, quick beating
of his heart. When she came to certain hateful and terrible
details, the count began to pace up and down the room<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>
like a caged wild beast, as he tore his hair, struck his
brow, and uttered cries of rage. Once more alone, a
thousand wild ideas passed through his mind. He thought
of going to the Quiñones' house and taking away the child by
force; he wanted to wring the neck of the vile woman; he
wanted to tell Don Pedro the whole story; he wanted to inform
the judge, and have the infamous creature imprisoned.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these fits of rage were as short as they were
violent, and then ensued prostration and tears. He went
to the house of his <i>fiancée</i> and told her with sobs what had
happened, thus making his confession for the first time.
The good Fernanda mingled her tears with his, distressed
at the fate of the unhappy little creature, and at the misery
of her lover. They spent some time talking over the
terrible events, and seeking means of thwarting that direful
revenge. Fernanda at last persuaded him to try gentle
means. To think of compassing anything by force was
absurd, for the count, not having yet acknowledged his sin,
he had no legal right over the child. To provoke a scandal
was useless. No servant would dare witness against his
mistress, and things would be worse than they were before.
Finally, the count decided to write a letter to his old
love.</p>

<p>"I have just heard that our Josefina, our adored Josefina,
is undergoing incredible tortures at your hands. I believe
it is a vile calumny. I know your character is quick and
fiery, but it is noble, and I cannot attribute such cowardice
to you. I only write to you to ascertain that the angelic
little creature continues to be the delight of your life. If it
should not be so, tell me, and we will find some means of
transferring her to my care. I suppose you are aware of
the step I am about to take. I have nothing to say to you
on the subject. The step was inevitable, sooner or later.
At all events, you can be sure that my remorse is softened
by the sweet recollection of the years that I have loved you.
Farewell! Write me some kind word."<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p class="head">THE CAPITULATION</p>


<p class="nind">J<span class="smcap">osefina</span> was wasting away. Her cheeks were as pale as
wax; there was constantly a look of terror in her sweet,
gentle eyes, around which suffering had traced a purple circle.
She spoke little, and never laughed. When she was left in
peace she sat in some corner, and remained motionless
looking at one spot, or she went to the window and wrote
on the panes of the glass with her finger.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in spite of such misery, the childish nature
asserted itself. If the cat approached her slowly with his
tail in the air, his back arched, soliciting a caress with a
weak purr, she would throw herself upon the ground, call
him, drag him to her, stroke his fur, scratch his head,
tickle the back of his neck, and murmur words of affection
in his ear, a course of spoiling that the animal received with
transports of delight.</p>

<p>"I love you, I love you. You are my good cat. Are
you not good? You must not scratch me as you did. Who
do you like best in the house? Say, treasure. Who gave you
a sardine yesterday? Who puts you a saucer of milk every
day? And if I could always give you fish too, I would,
because I know it is what you like best. Is it not, my
treasure? But you must not steal or you know you will be
beaten. Don't get on Manin's bed and be naughty or you
will be killed. I heard so the other day in the kitchen. And
catch a lot of mice, so that godmother will like you and will
not turn you out."<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></p>

<p>The cat, delighted, purred from the depths of his throat
with pleasure, and rubbed himself more and more vehemently
against her. The child held him up to her mouth,
put her arms around him, pressed him to her heart, kissed
him, and sometimes, forgetting her sufferings, she shed tears
of tenderness. But any noise in the next room made her
jump up with terror in her eyes, she pushed the cat away
from her and stood motionless, waiting for what was to
come, and it was almost always some cruel punishment.</p>

<p>"You naughty girl! So you dirty your clothes like
that crawling about on the floor! Wait a bit! wait a
bit!"</p>

<p>Continual shocks had so upset her constitution that her
health was quite out of order. But although it was not her
fault she was treated as if it were, and once Concha's fury
was so great that she seized her by the ears and made her
lick the ground.</p>

<p>The most terrible hour for the little creature was lesson
time. Amalia gave her early in the morning long pieces of
sacred history and grammar to learn. Josefina retired to a
corner and made desperate efforts to commit them to
memory. A little before the dinner hour Concha, who was
deputed for the task, took a chair, drew out the famous
whalebone, and with that in one hand, and the book in the
other, she commenced her pedagogic functions. Every
time the child hesitated or forgot a word, it cost her a
blow from the whalebone on her face, hand, or neck; and
as her memory was not very strong the pounding was
incessant.</p>

<p>It was still worse when her godmother taught her.
Concha was coldly cruel, but Amalia became irritable
directly; the crying of the child worried her nerves, she flew
into a rage like a hungry panther, and finished by striking
her frantically until she fell trembling and bleeding at her
feet.</p>

<p>Her hatred to the little creature seemed increased if<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>
possible after the letter from the count. Her pride,
wounded to the quick by the cold, self-sufficient, insulting
diplomacy conveyed to her mind by the words of her old
love, she vented her rage upon the daughter. Besides, the
idea of Luis being distressed at hearing of the tortures was
an additional inducement to continue them unsparingly.
Let her suffer! let him suffer! the vile, perfidious creature
who had taken her youth, and then when she was old cast
her from him like an old rag to be swept away.</p>

<p>On one of these days of intense raging anger the life of
Josefina was in imminent danger. At the usual hour she
had been summoned to the dining-room for her lessons.
Concha took a seat and drew with unfeigned delight the
fatal whalebone from her bosom, for the administration of
blows seemed a physical pleasure that day. Trembling as
usual the child came and gave her the books, and then
with stammering tongue began saying a chapter of sacred
history, when Manin's entrance interrupted them. He
came in with his eternal green jacket, short breeches and
rough manners, making the floor tremble under his hobnailed
boots. It was this costume, which even in the
country was out of date, that chiefly gave rise to the notoriety
and fame he had been supposed to have as a
formidable bear-hunter. He entered with his head down
as usual; he peered in at the door, saying:</p>

<p>"Concha, haven't you anything to eat here?"</p>

<p>"Is your stomach so empty, Manin?" returned the
needlewoman laughing.</p>

<p>The peasant opened his mouth wide to join in the
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, God have mercy! I can't wait a minute more.
You all seem barefooted Brothers in this house; you have
no thought of food till the time comes."</p>

<p>"Well, come along you great greedy creature," said
Concha putting the book and whalebone on the chair, and
going in a petulant way to the dresser.<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></p>

<p>They quite understood each other these two. The
needlewoman was hard, cruel, and stubborn, but the majordomo
knew how to get at the few grains of good humour
she had. He teased her unmercifully, he pinched her when
she passed by him, and said a thousand coarse, shameless
things to her which she knew how to take in the opposite
sense. And the dwarfish maid, who was neither kind nor
pretty, and whose cruel nature had choked every germ of
pleasantness and transformed her into a priestess of misery,
a fatal, pitiless Eumenide, was pleasant and obliging to that
brute. She admired his bearish manners, his roughness,
his greediness, and his insolent, careless way of treating
everybody, including the pompous Señor de Quiñones.
Manin was a solemn-faced rogue with his shameful rudeness,
his deportment of a brave hunter of wild beasts. Sly-faced
rogue! for with all his shameless rudeness, his posing
as a hunter of wild beasts, and his slovenly dress, he had
known how to take life easily in this world without spoiling
his hands, nor hurting his back by hard work in his village.
The needlewoman fetched a plate of cold meat and put
it on the oilcloth of the table without any apology for a
serviette; then she cut half a loaf and left him with the
indispensable bottle of white wine and a glass by the side
of the meat. Concha then re-seated herself, and the child
approaching repeated the words that she had just said. In
a few moments, zas! a blow with the whalebone and a cry
of pain. Immediately afterwards another blow and another
cry, and so it went on. The needlewoman was delighted
that she stumbled more than usual. Manin devoured his
food in silence, only occasionally turning his head with
marked indifference towards the sad scene. Soon he
began murmuring at every blow like a machine:</p>

<p>"Give it! Go it! That was good! There's a blow!"
and other similar exclamations.</p>

<p>The sacred history lesson came to an end, and there was
a respite before taking the grammar, when the maid began<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>
joking cheerfully with the majordomo. She was in an
angelic humour.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such meat?"</p>

<p>"Fine, truely fine."</p>

<p>"The worst of it is it will spoil your appetite for dinner."</p>

<p>Whereupon the room then vibrated with the fellow's
laughter.</p>

<p>"This? Yes! It would be something for me to lose
my appetite. You will have to put a hot iron in the water,
like you do for the señora."</p>

<p>"I would put it on your body, you great pig."</p>

<p>"Look here, Concha, none of your teasing; because
although you are only a little bit of a thing, and you
have roguish eyes and a mouth like a cherry, you shall
have such a blow one of these days, without your knowing
whence it comes, that all that little row of pearls I see now
shall be knocked down your throat."</p>

<p>"Silence! silence, you old clod-hopper; you are a fine
one for blows. You couldn't give them if you tried in such
a tight costume. You are indeed a fright."</p>

<p>"You are not saying this from your heart, but because
you think it fine."</p>

<p>"I know very well that there is a good deal behind all
that. (And here he gave her a few rough digs in the ribs).
If I could catch you in a maize field!"</p>

<p>"It would only be as if you caught me in the market-place.
No; you are nothing but jaw and tongue."</p>

<p>"And hands too to touch what is nice," returned the
barbarian, taking hold of the needlewoman's chin with his
hand.</p>

<p>"Leave go! leave go, you pig!" And she gave him a
blow on the fingers with the whalebone. Then the rude
fellow caught hold of her again, and she defended herself
again in the same way. He then tried to get hold of her
waist, whereupon the maid ran across the room pretending
to be angry.<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></p>

<p>"Don't touch me, Manin, or I will call the señora."</p>

<p>But Manin did not care; he ran after her with grunts
and laughter, catching hold of her here and seizing her
there, whilst his cheeks, which were as hard and coarse as
an elephant's hide, came in for blows from the servant,
without showing that he felt them. The furniture was
knocked about, the ground shook, the plates rang on the
dresser, and still he did not give in, but he grew more and
more false and fawning. The rogue knew that, irascible
and fiendish as the little woman was, she was open to
flattery like all human beings, and that it was for the
interest of his stomach to keep her in a good humour.
Finally, roaring like a bull, he caught her by the waist and
held her up in the air. He held her up without any effort,
as if she were a three-year old child.</p>

<p>"Now, little spitfire, what do you say now? Where is
your courage? Where are your hands? Come, witch, and
ask pardon, or I will let you fall like a frog," roared the
great bear, moving her to and fro in the air.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Manin! Let me go, ass! There will be a
row! Look here, I shall scream!"</p>

<p>At last he put her down gently, and the maid, panting,
dishevelled and frowning, so as to look more angry, said
in an excited voice:</p>

<p>"You have no shame, Manin. If we were not in this
house as we are I would smash this lamp on your face for
your rudeness and insolence. But here are the servants
listening to all this, and what will they say? Don't say
another word, for I won't answer you."</p>

<p>"So you can scream now, vain little thing, after you have
been in the seventh heaven," muttered Manin, in a drawling
tone, looking at her angrily and pushing up his beard.</p>

<p>"If you don't get out of my sight, you ruffian!" exclaimed
the little servant, as she looked at him with
laughter in her eyes, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Then Manin re-seated himself for the consumption of<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>
the rest of the bread, and to drink another glass of white
wine. Josefina meanwhile sobbed in a corner, putting her
wounded hands to her mouth and patting her cheeks, contused
with the whalebone blows. Manin then deigned to
cast a look at her.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little fool, the pain of the blows will go by,
and the sense will remain in your head for ever," he said,
cutting a piece of bread with his clasp-knife and putting it
into his mouth. "If you would like to know my opinion,
the more they beat you, the more pleased you ought to be.
What would you be if Concha was not kind enough to beat
you well? A little ignoramus, not worth a measure of
acorns, a little beast, God save the comparison. And now
what will you be? As fine a woman as you can see." (He
paused whilst he cut another piece of bread and chewed it
so that it caused a large lump in his right cheek). "Come,
if I had had masters like you have to bruise my skin with
blows, I should not be an ass now; they would not call me
Manin, but Don Manuel, and instead of being a miserable
underling I should be going about giving myself airs, walking
down Altavilla with my hands behind me like the
señores, and reading the papers in the casinos." (Another
pause, and another cutting of a hunch of bread). "It is
nothing but just, if you will see it so. How can you learn
such difficult things without a few whippings? Whoever
learned <i>daqué</i> without being beaten? Nobody. Then if
you get learning you should thank God for having put a
mistress over you like an aureole. For the end will please
you; you will have soft hands and delicate feet, is it
not so?"</p>

<p>Concha, having now resumed her severe manner, seated
herself and made an imperious gesture to the child to
approach. It was the turn for grammar and it went worse
than the history, either from want of memory or because
she was upset by fear. Then the whipping recommenced;
a whalebone blow now and then, then oftener and oftener.<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>
Manin, true to his pedagogical opinions, applauded with his
mouth full, and cut his bread into wonderful geometrical
shapes before conducting them with all solemnity to his
mouth. The faults were many, the blows were the same.
But at the end of the lesson Concha thought that besides
the punishment at every fault there was a certain reparation
due for general naughtiness, and so she had better conclude
by a beating that would include everything. Therefore
she jumped up from her chair, and brandishing the
formidable whalebone, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now to make you study better and to open your mind!
Now!"</p>

<p>The blows were so hard and so many that, trying to
escape the torture, the little creature seized hold of the
skirts of her torturer with her clenched hands. Without
knowing how, perhaps through having carelessly caught
hold of them, the string which held them broke and they
fell off, leaving the needlewoman only in her undergarment.
She gave a cry of shame and quickly pulled up the skirts.
Then, without waiting to tie them on again, she cast a
glance of the deepest anger at the child and left the room
holding her things on with her hands.</p>

<p>"You have done it finely now&mdash;finely, finely, finely!" said
Manin, dexterously cutting the mouthful he was about to
raise to his lips.</p>

<p>The little creature paralysed with terror did not cry even;
her wounds ceased to hurt her. At the end of a few
minutes Concha reappeared accompanied by the señora,
who came in with a sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>"It seems that the señorita takes pleasure now in unrobing
girls in public. You like that, señorita, do you not?
Manin must have had a nice view of Concha. Eh, Manin?"</p>

<p>She took a few steps forward. The child receded in
dismay.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, señorita. I have not come to beat
you. Who gives heed to whippings? I have only come<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>
to invite you to take a turn in the cellar&mdash;the cellar with
the rats&mdash;you know it. There you can amuse yourself in
undressing any rat of the many that will pay their respects
to you. Come along. Give me your hand so that I can
take you with all ceremony."</p>

<p>The child ran behind a chair, from whence, being
pursued by Amalia and Concha, she got under the table,
and finally took refuge behind the majordomo.</p>

<p>"Manin! Manin! For God's sake hide me!"</p>

<p>But he took her by the arm and handed her over to the
señora. Then they each took a hand, and in spite of her
piercing cries they dragged her off.</p>

<p>"To the cellar, no! to the cellar, no! Godmother,
pardon. Kill me sooner. See what a terror I have. No,
not to the cellar for the rats to eat me!"</p>

<p>The servants came out in the passage and assisted at the
scene in solemn silence. The cries of the child were soon
lost in descending the dark winding staircase leading to the
underground cellar.</p>

<p>Amalia opened the door of the horrible place and pushed
her daughter inside. She banged the door to, and the
child running to get out, caught her hand in it. A fearful
cry of pain was heard. The Valencian reopened the door,
and gave such a rough push to the child that she was thrown
on the ground, and then she turned the key.</p>

<p>The cellar was a dark, damp prison, only lightened by a
few stray rays of light from an ox-eye above. It had once
been used as a wine-cellar, now there were only empty
bottles there. Scarcely was the child alone, when she got
up, looked round mad with fright, tried to cry, but she was
unable to utter, and finally, extending her hands in an excess
of fearful trembling, she fell senseless to the ground. At
the end of half an hour the stable-boy, who had witnessed
the incarceration, came to the door being moved by compassion,
and looked through the keyhole. There was
nothing to be seen. He called very gently:<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></p>

<p>"Josefina."</p>

<p>The child did not reply. He called louder. The same
silence. Alarmed, he called and knocked at the door
with all his might without obtaining any reply. Then, at
the risk of losing his place, he went quickly upstairs to say
what had happened. Amalia sent Concha with the key to
see what had occurred. Paula and she together carried
the little creature upstairs senseless, cold, and with all the
signs of death upon her face. Afraid of the complications
that might arise, the wife of the Grandee put her quickly to
bed, where she soon came to herself, but a serious fever
immediately set in. The doctor was sent for. He found
her very ill. To account for the injury of her hand and the
contusions about her, Amalia, clever in lying, invented a
story that the doctor believed, or pretended to believe.
She hovered for some days between life and death.
Amalia followed the course of the illness with anxious eyes.
She was not unhappy at the thought of losing the being
upon whom she had vented the bitter disappointment of
her heart, but she was distressed at the idea of losing her
revenge at one blow. When Josefina had been in bed
three days, she heard that Fernanda had left for Madrid
the previous evening in the postchaise, and that Luis would
only be four or five days before joining her. This was a
severe shock; a burning wave of bile inundated her heart,
and that night she too had fever. So they were escaping!
There would be no possible revenge for the traitor. He
would go to Madrid; he would marry; he would perhaps
have news there of his daughter's death, but the caresses of
his adored bride would soon put it out of his mind. Of
that long, ardent love affair there would be nothing left but
a man parading his bliss through Europe, and a poor old
sad woman in Lancia, a laughing-stock for the Lancian
circles. Her flaccid flesh trembled. The revengeful instincts
of her race cried out in futile rage. No, no, it
could not be! She would sooner drag his dead daughter<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>
to his feet; she would sooner kill him with a stab in the
heart!</p>

<p>A singular and terrible idea occurred to her&mdash;to tell her
husband everything. She ignored what she would incur
herself, but it would provoke an immediate scandal. Don
Pedro was violent, and he enjoyed great power and prestige.
Who could say the harm that such a bomb would cause?
Certainly he was paralysed, and he could not take personal
revenge; but would not that proud, punctilious man find
means of repaying the injury that had been done him? She
would come to grief herself, but she would willingly fall if
the traitor paid for his treachery. After a long struggle with
these thoughts she did not dare run the risk of making the
confession by word of mouth, nor writing under her own
name, but, disguising the handwriting, she wrote an anonymous
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The child that you adopted six years ago is the
daughter of your wife and a gentleman who visits your
house, whom you call your friend. I do not tell you the
name. Look for him, and you will soon come across the
traitor.</p>

<p class="signature">(Signed) <span class="smcap">A faithful friend.</span>"</p></div>

<p>She posted the epistle and anxiously waited to see the
effect.</p>

<p>Don Pedro received it in her presence and read it, whilst her
face violently contracted and assumed a cadaverous pallor.</p>

<p>"Who writes to you?" she asked in a natural way.</p>

<p>The Grandee replied immediately, and folding and retaining
the letter, he said, with some effort to control his
voice that trembled:</p>

<p>"Nobody. One of the persons I recommended, complains
that he has been kept waiting. This governor! He has
nor memory, no regularity at all!"</p>

<p>Anxiously and restlessly awaiting the course of events,<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>
she retired to her boudoir. Jacoba came in the evening
with an air of mystery and gave her a letter from the
count.</p>

<p>"What does this man want with me?" she asked in a
surprised, vexed tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know, señorita. He wrote the letter in my
house, and is there waiting for the answer."</p>

<p>The count's letter ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Amalia, I know that our child is in danger of death.
By all that you love best in the world, by the salvation of
your soul, grant me an interview. I must speak to you. If this
evening it cannot be, come to-morrow to Jacoba's house.</p>

<p class="signature">Yours, <span style="margin-left: 5%;"><span class="smcap">Luis.</span>"</span></p></div>

<p>"Yours! yours!" she murmured with a bitter smile. "You
have been mine, but you have changed your owner, and it
will cost you dear."</p>

<p>"Shall I take the answer, señorita?"</p>

<p>She stood pensive for a few minutes, walked up and down
the room completely absorbed in thought, went to the
window and looked through the panes. Finally, half turning
round, she said very abruptly:</p>

<p>"Very well; I will go to-morrow at the hour of Mass."</p>

<p>"He asked after the child with the greatest interest."</p>

<p>"Say that she is better."</p>

<p>The intermediary retired, and Amalia remained for a long
time looking at the street through the window-panes without
seeing it. From seven o'clock in the morning of the following
day, Luis was waiting for her in Jacoba's little house.
It only consisted of a kitchen on the ground-floor and a
little bedroom upstairs, and both so low that the count's
head, with his hat on, touched the ceiling. In this little
room he was walking up and down with impatient steps,
with his hands in his pockets looking cautiously every
minute through the blinds of the only window there was.<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>
The lady did not arrive until nine o'clock. He saw her
coming with her mantilla veiling her eyes, her missal in
her hand, and her rosary hanging on her wrist, with a firm,
self-assured step, as if she were coming to give orders to her
old protégée. When he heard her voice in the kitchen his
heart beat quickly, he began to tremble, and in his agitation
he forgot all that he was going to say.</p>

<p>"How are you, count?" she said, with perfect naturalness
as she came in and gave him her hand.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;and thou?"</p>

<p>She raised her head as if she were surprised to hear him
<i>tutoyer</i> her, and replied, as she looked at him fixedly:</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"And the child?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat better."</p>

<p>The man's face brightened at hearing this news. A ray
of happiness shone in his eyes, and taking the hand of his
former lover, he led her to the poor, straw-stuffed sofa, and
said:</p>

<p>"Let us sit down, Amalia. Although it may be a liberty
on my part, I beg of you to let me go on <i>tutoyant</i> you when
we are alone. I do not forget, I never can forget, how
many happy hours I owe you, and how much happiness you
brought into my sad, monotonous life. You revealed to
me all that was sweetest and best in my heart without my
hardly suspecting it. All the first impulses of my soul
were for you. Until now, you alone had penetrated it and
sounded, and knew its melancholy, weakness, and tenderness.
If I separate from you, it is only in obedience to a
law of nature which impels us all to found a family. I have
nobody in the world but my mother, who may soon leave
me alone. You ought not to mind my wishing to make a
home, and have an heir to my name and estates. Besides,
my conscience rebukes me."</p>

<p>The count, delighted at the improvement of the child,
was more expansive and loquacious than usual, being<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>
unable to hide his happiness, and thinking everything was
arranged according to his wishes. Josefina was happy
with her mother, he happy with Fernanda, and Amalia,
being resigned, would grant him a sweet affection that
would get purer every day.</p>

<p>She looked at him now with a certain quizzical curiosity.</p>

<p>When he had finished, she said, with a sarcastic smile:</p>

<p>"From the night you saw Fernanda in her splendid
<i>recherché</i> dress, this feeling of conscience must have been
insupportable."</p>

<p>The count smiled too, somewhat shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"Don't believe it, Amalia. I have always felt remorse.
Certainly, on getting old, one sees things more clearly. My
beard is white in many places, as you can see. That which
is excusable in a youth as wildness, as an irrepressible
ebullition of vitality, becomes crime in an older person. Love
at my age ought not to clip the wings of reason, and if it
does, it merits the term of madness. My determination
may be hard for both of us. It is very trying to me; it
costs me a good deal to break loose from a <i>liaison</i> that
force of time has almost converted into a habit. Besides,
unfortunately, there exists a bond between us which is
impossible to break completely. Destiny has brought forth
from the mire of our sin a beautiful blossom, a sweet white
lily. Let us remove the stain from her brow, although she
is the offspring of an unlawful passion, do not let us corrupt
her with our blameworthy conduct. Let us make ourselves
worthy of her by living like Christians."</p>

<p>"All this is very well, only I am sorry that this course of
Christian doctrine has come so late, and so simultaneous
with the arrival of your old <i>fiancée</i> to the place, because
it seems as if you had completely forgotten your catechism,
until she came to refresh your memory. But, after all, it is
not for me to interfere as it does not concern me. The
gist of it all is that you are going to marry. You do well.
Man is badly off alone, and when he finds a worthy com<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>panion
like you have done, he ought not to lose the
opportunity. Fernanda is a very good girl; I am sure that
she will make you happy; you will have many sons, and
after a long and happy life you will go to heaven."</p>

<p>This state of resignation surprised Luis and he could not
help feeling somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p>"And you, too, will be happy?" he timidly asked.</p>

<p>"I? what does it signify if I am happy or unhappy?"
she said, shrugging her shoulders disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Amalia! Happiness is not that madness
to which we have given ourselves up these seven
years. There is a taste of bitterness in that, which I have
noticed for some time and which you will soon perceive.
A pure, worthy life, a quiet conscience, and the esteem of
honourable persons will give you more pleasure than
criminal passion. Besides, you have what I have not;
you have an angel with you, a fragrant, beautiful lily that
will sweeten your existence."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Josefina! Really, so she is to be the one who
is to afford me my only pleasant times in the future!"</p>

<p>This was said with such a strange inflexion of voice, so
sharp and so strident that Luis shivered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say, that it is fortunate I have Josefina
to cheer me."</p>

<p>"But you say it in such a strange way."</p>

<p>The Valencian then gave a curious forced laugh of
sinister sound that came from the back of her throat.</p>

<p>Luis looked at her fixedly, getting more and more uneasy.</p>

<p>"But what a fool you are, Luis! How more than foolish!
Egotism has so blinded your eyes that you cannot see what
is before you. If you were twenty, this innocence might
perhaps inspire me with pity, but at your age it only fills
me with scorn and derision. To think that three or four
insolent remarks on morality and conscience will suffice to<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>
make me contentedly accept the humiliation you impose
upon me; to suppose that I, whom if you do not know,
you ought to know, am going to consent to be cast away
like an old rag, that I am to crawl like an enamoured slave
at the feet of Fernanda, to serve her as a footstool when she
mounts to her couch, is the height of stupidity and nonsense.
Why don't you ask me to be bridesmaid at once?"</p>

<p>The count looked at her with dilated eyes full of anxiety
and fear.</p>

<p>"So what I have heard of the tortures you have inflicted
on our daughter is true?"</p>

<p>"Quite true! And you do not yet know all. Look
here, I am going to tell you all, so that you may not say
you are deceived."</p>

<p>Then, in a few incisive words, with a cruel satisfaction
revealed in her voice, she put before him the fearful picture
of the pain and misery suffered by the unhappy little
creature during the last few months. The account was
infinitely more shocking than the one Maria, the ironer,
had given. The count, pale and overwhelmed, without
making the slightest movement, looked the picture of
despair. He soon covered his face with his hands, and so
listened until the end.</p>

<p>"Oh, how infamous! oh, how infamous!" he groaned to
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, very infamous, but I hope to be more so. Have
you heard all these infamies? Then they are nothing compared
to what I shall do."</p>

<p>"You shall not do it, you wicked woman!" exclaimed
Luis. "I would sooner strangle you with my own hands."</p>

<p>The Valencian rushed to the door.</p>

<p>"If you come a step nearer, I'll shriek!"</p>

<p>"Oh, infamous, infamous person!" exclaimed the count,
again in a deep voice, "and God allows such monsters
upon the earth!"</p>

<p>He took a few steps back and cast himself again upon the<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>
sofa. He rested his elbows on his knees, and put his head
between his hands. After some time he raised it saying:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you exact from me?"</p>

<p>Amalia took a step towards him.</p>

<p>"That which you ought to expect, if you have any common
sense left. I don't ask for our connection to continue,
because at the pass we have come to it is not possible; it
would be like giving the lie to love, and I have too much
pride for that. But I do not want you or this woman to
make me a laughing-stock; I am not going to be made a
subject of derision to those who know of our connection:
and those are all who visit at the house. I demand as the
condition of the child being as she was, that you immediately
break with Fernanda and think no more of her."</p>

<p>"But, Amalia," he exclaimed, in accents of misery, "you
know quite well it is impossible; my wedding is fixed; all
Lancia knows it. Fernanda is waiting for me in Madrid;
only a few days are wanting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if only a minute were wanting, this wedding shall
not take place. If you marry Fernanda the child shall pay
for the offence in the way you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will prevent it. I will tell the authorities. I will
ask for the care of the child."</p>

<p>"This is only talking for talking sake, Luis," replied
Amalia, calm and smiling. "The authorities of Lancia are
under the Quiñones. Nobody would dare say a word
against me."</p>

<p>"If I refer the whole matter to Don Pedro."</p>

<p>"He will not believe you, and if he did believe you,
instead of impeding my revenge which is also his, he would
help me."</p>

<p>A long silence then ensued. The count was plunged in
thought with his hand pressed against his brow. Suddenly
he rose hastily, and walked up and down the room in an
agitated way.</p>

<p>"It cannot be! it cannot be!"<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></p>

<p>The Valencian followed him with her eyes. At last she
said, as she walked to the door:</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>The count retained her with a gesture. "Stop."</p>

<p>Amalia stopped motionless, with her hand on the latch
of the door as her piercing glance rested upon him.</p>

<p>The count went on walking for some time without paying
any attention to her.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, in a hoarse voice, stopping short,
"the marriage shall not take place; you will tell me what I
am to do."</p>

<p>His altered face evinced the calmness of despair.</p>

<p>"You will have to write a letter to Fernanda to bade her
farewell."</p>

<p>"I will write it."</p>

<p>"Now, at once."</p>

<p>"Now, at once."</p>

<p>Amalia went to the stairs and asked Jacoba for a writing-case.
As there was no table there, she put it on the chest
of drawers. The count approached and began to write
standing. Amalia approached too.</p>

<p>"This is what I want you to write to her."</p>

<p>It was the rough draft of the letter. The count cast his
eye over it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My good friend Fernanda," it ran, "I wanted you to be
away so as to tell you in writing what would be beyond my
powers to say to you. I cannot be yours. It is not necessary
to give you the reasons because you will guess them.
Would that I loved you enough to ignore everything and fly
with you! Unfortunately, or fortunately, there are things
that weigh on my heart more than love. Pardon me for
having deceived you and try to be happy as it is the wish of
your best friend.</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Luis.</span>"</p></div>

<p>He traced the lines of this letter with a trembling hand,
and before finishing it, tears rose to his eyes.<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></p>



<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p class="head">JOSEFINA SLEEPS</p>


<p class="nind">T<span class="smcap">he</span> noble Grandee easily guessed the author of his disgrace.
As soon as he read the anonymous letter and recovered
his self-command, his suspicions fell upon the
Conde de Onis. In this he was only influenced by the
likeness that he now clearly saw between him and the
foundling. For either his excessive pride had blinded his
eyes, or else because Amalia had known how to keep him
deceived, he had never noticed anything between them
beyond a cool, conventional friendship at which nobody
could have taken umbrage. The same pride arrested the
course of his bitter thoughts by making the most of this
consideration. Why give any importance to what an
anonymous letter said? Why not suppose it was a vile
calumny by which some enemy tried to envenom his existence?
But the dart had gone so deep into his heart that
he could not pull it out. All the considerations invented
by his inclination could not destroy the perfect conviction
that, without his knowing how, had taken shape in his
brain. Sundry details, unnoticed at the time, soon stood
out and guided him like lighted torches. The first of all
was naturally the illness of his wife simultaneous with the
appearance of the child. He recalled her strange aversion
to having a doctor to see her; then the indulgence and
extreme attention lavished on the child. He also recollected
the visits that at one time his wife made to the
Grange on the pretext of getting plants. There was no<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>
circumstance connected with the count's friendship and the
finding of the child that he did not turn over and weigh
thoughtfully. He became silent and meditative. The hard
look of his piercing eyes was always fixed upon Amalia
directly she came into the room. Sometimes he had the
child fetched on some pretext or another, and looked at
her for a long time trying to decipher in the lines of her
face the enigma of her existence.</p>

<p>Amalia saw all this, and read the thoughts of her husband
like an open book.</p>

<p>"When is Luis to be married?" asked the Grandee one
day in an assumed, careless tone.</p>

<p>"They say it will be some time yet. He has to arrange
I don't know how many matters before going to Madrid,"
she replied, with the greatest calmness.</p>

<p>"Is he still at the Grange?"</p>

<p>"Yes, always; he only comes in sometimes of an evening,
according to what he told me one day when I met him in
Barrosa's shop."</p>

<p>The very next evening the count appeared at the party.</p>

<p>"What? You here? Have you left the Grange?" Don
Pedro asked, with a penetrating glance.</p>

<p>"Definitely, no; I have the carriage below. I am going
back to sleep."</p>

<p>"You must be dull there, eh?" asked Don Cristobal
Mateo.</p>

<p>"In the day, no; I am very busy with agricultural
occupations, with the mill, cattle, &amp;c. But the evenings
are very long."</p>

<p>Luis only came for the sake of seeing his daughter.
Amalia had not allowed it until the child had partially recovered;
then she was dressed as before, and she resumed
her old rights. But not the affection. The charm was
gone, because Luis hated her, especially through having
had to submit through coercion. With the ardent passion
full of love and mystery there had also mingled an attach<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>ment
to the little creature. But the tortures that her mad
anger inflicted on the little girl had made a gulf between
them. The poor child, clad in rich clothes, wandered alone
about the palace of the Quiñones without inspiring any one
with tenderness. Amalia avoided her. The servants,
ashamed of their unkind treatment, and sulky at the sudden
change which put the foundling again above them, did not
speak to her. The long martyrdom she had undergone
and the terrible illness with which it terminated had made
great ravages in her appearance. Her pale cheek was as
transparent as mother-of-pearl; there was still a dark black
circle from agitation and pain round her eyes. The count's
heart contracted every time he saw her, and it cost him
some effort to restrain his tears.</p>

<p>Amalia did not tell her lover of the imprudent anonymous
letter she had sent to Quiñones. Fearing from her husband's
excitability some serious consequence would ensue,
she determined to get him off the scent, as it was not
possible to restore his tranquillity. The course that seemed
to her best to take was to remove his suspicions from Luis
and put them on Jaime Moro. He was the only one who,
by his position, age, and appearance could seem like a
probable lover. She began by treating him before Don
Pedro with particular partiality, picking him out from the
other guests in a very conspicuous manner. She cast smiling,
significant glances at him; she took pleasure in standing
behind his chair when he was playing at <i>tresillo</i> and joking
with him; she called him every minute to her on some
pretext or other, and then kept him at her side with long
whispering conversations in which her cheek came in close
proximity with his. It was not so easy as it seemed to
make a conquest of Moro, although it was only a make-believe.
He was not at all churlish; on the contrary, he
had a just reputation of being gentlemanly and courteous
with ladies; but when ladies stand in the way of billiards or
<i>tresillo</i> there is nobody six miles round so cross and uncivil.<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>
Amalia was a great bore to him when the <i>tresillo</i> players
were waiting for him. Then his answers to her questions
did not come readily; he smiled mechanically and gave
frequent longing glances at the table where his companions
were enjoying the delights of some trick with a good
suit.</p>

<p>"Moro, sit here, we will have a chat together."</p>

<p>Moro trembled as if the world were coming to an end.
He took a seat by the side of the lady with a face that was
very long, not at all consistent with the passion that was
supposed to consume his breast. The Grandee had paid
little heed to these marks of favour and insinuating
smiles of his wife. He looked at them with vacant eyes
without any suspicion arising in his mind, which was
entirely turned in the right direction. Nevertheless,
Amalia was so persistent and seemed so engrossed, that
the noble gentleman began to pay heed to those signs
and to attribute some significance to them. The Valencian
felt the pleasure of triumph. Her machinations
were about to be realised. And to give an important,
decisive stroke to her plot, she suddenly thought of a
dangerous trick. She was seated in a corner with Jaime
Moro at her side, quite in sight of Don Pedro. Moro was
<i>distrait</i> as usual, and the wife of Quiñones had to make
prodigious efforts to sustain the conversation; she smiled,
she coquetted, she involved him in a mesh of honeyed
phrases, which she greatly intensified with her smile so as to
attract Don Pedro's attention.</p>

<p>"What is it? Are you looking at my bracelet?"</p>

<p>Moro had not noticed it.</p>

<p>"It is very pretty," he quickly returned politely.</p>

<p>"It belonged to my mother. It is better than it looks.
This portrait, which is of my grandmother, is made in
mosaic. Look!"</p>

<p>Whereupon she raised her hand, and Moro looked at it
with assumed admiration.<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></p>

<p>"Look well at it."</p>

<p>And she raised it a little more so as to bring it near his
face. Then seeing out of the corner of her eye that Don
Pedro was looking at her, she lifted it a little more so as to
brush the lips of the young man; then she instantly withdrew
it with a quick gesture. Moro was quite taken aback. He
involuntarily looked at Don Pedro, and seeing that his
glance was fixed on him with a cold piercing look, he
coloured up to the eyes; and Amalia rose and left the
room as if to hide her confusion.</p>

<p>The proud Grandee was fully overwhelmed by the secret
that he thought he had discovered. His ideas underwent a
sudden shock. Agitated by a thousand conflicting suspicions,
dominated by furious anger, he moved the cards
in his trembling hands without thinking of them, for his mind
was full of awful revenge against his wife and against him.
Against whom? Who was the traitor? Doubt inflamed his
rage. What he had seen was very conclusive. Nevertheless,
he could not get the Conde de Onis out of his mind. The
testimony of his eyes was arrayed against his instinct,
a voice within that told him continually the name of his
enemy.</p>

<p>The count himself then appeared at the party. He
greeted Amalia coldly, and was going straight to the library,
when Manuel Antonio caught hold of him by the tail of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to, Luis? Come here, boy; don't go
and bury yourself in the game directly. Look here, Maria
Josefa and Jovita have been disputing every evening about
the date of your marriage. But I said to them: 'Don't
dispute any more. If Luis comes to-day he is so kind that
he will certainly tell you himself.'"</p>

<p>"Then you told them wrong," replied the count, approaching
the group.</p>

<p>"Have you turned so cross then?"</p>

<p>"It is not crossness, it is ignorance. These ladies know<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>
very well that things don't happen as, and when, we wish.
If I were to name a date now, and it turned out differently
they would think that I had been making fun of
them."</p>

<p>In spite of the efforts he made to smile, the face of the
count expressed infinite sadness, and his voice was low and
hoarse.</p>

<p>"No, no! nothing of the sort!" exclaimed Jovita, laughing.
"Tell us any day, and if it should turn out differently
we shall think it was not by your wish."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So soon as that!" cried both old maids in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are not easy to please. What day do you want me
to marry? Fix it yourselves."</p>

<p>The count had not said a word to anybody about his
marriage being broken off. The innate weakness of his
character made him withhold a piece of news that would so
soon spread abroad. He fought shy of public curiosity and
avoided questions at which his face might betray the cause
of such a determination. And he trembled and became
profoundly sad every time, like now, the matter was alluded
to. Until then nothing had transpired. It was thought in
the town from day to day that he would go to Madrid to
join his bride. Nevertheless, Manuel Antonio, whose olfactory
sense was superior to that of all his contemporaries,
had scented something. And with the tenacity and dissimulation
of an Isabella of England, he began to collect
bits of news and piece them together in such a way that at
the present time he was very near the truth.</p>

<p>"You seem very sad, Luisito," he said to him suddenly.
"You look more like making your will than being
married."</p>

<p>The count was affected, and not knowing what to say, he
answered, with a forced smile:</p>

<p>"Marriage is a very serious step."<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></p>

<p>He then tried to beat a retreat, but Manuel Antonio
retained him again. He wanted to get a key to the enigma
at all costs, and to have his suspicions confirmed, so
seconded by Maria Josefa, who knew better than he what
line to adopt, he kept up the conversation for some time
on the difficult subject. Luis was on thorns. He kept
looking at Amalia, as if he were claiming what she had
been obliged to concede him. The lady at last rose, put
her head out of the door, and then resumed her seat.
In a few moments Josefina's pale, gentle face appeared.
She cast her sad eyes over the room, and at a sign from her
godmother she directed her steps to the library. She
passed the count, he half turned towards her and gave
her a rapid, anxious look, which did not escape the sharp
eyes of his interlocutors. The child raised her eyes shining
with a happy smile to his. It was a magnetic shock that
suddenly filled her childish heart with joy. The guests tried
to keep her, but obedient to the command of her godmother
she went on to the library. A few minutes afterwards,
Quiñones sharp voice was heard:</p>

<p>"Is not the Conde de Onis there? Why does he not
come in?"</p>

<p>"I am coming, Don Pedro," returned Luis, quickly, glad
to escape from the boring group.</p>

<p>On his entering the library, in less time than it takes to
tell, a terrible scene took place that put everything in commotion,
and terrified the guests. Don Pedro, with the cards
in his hand, was with Jaime Moro and Don Enrique Valero.
Saleta, who made the fourth, was sitting talking to the
chaplain behind him. Three or four people were standing
round the table watching the game. Josefina was near the
noble Grandee with her arms crossed, waiting for the
benediction before going to bed. At the count's entrance,
Quiñones darted a rapid, sharp glance at him, and then gave
one of deep hatred at the child, as he said, with a sarcastic
smile:<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a></p>

<p>"Ah, do you want your blessing? Take your blessing."</p>

<p>And so saying he gave her a tremendous blow that
felled her to the ground, whilst blood flowed from her
mouth and nostrils.</p>

<p>Luis seemed to feel the blow in his own cheeks. All the
blood left them and he turned deadly pale; then his will
being overpowered by a blind impulse, he cried out:</p>

<p>"It is a vile shame! It is a cowardly act!"</p>

<p>He then tried to throw himself on Quiñones, but the
others held him back, whilst Don Pedro called out in a
loud voice, mad with anger, "At last! At last, dog!"</p>

<p>He made a supreme effort to rise from his chair and
attack the destroyer of his honour. He half managed it,
but finally fell back senseless with his mouth distorted.
The guests had all risen and rushed to the library. The
ladies shrieked in terror. The men behind asked what
had happened. The Conde de Onis cast a frenzied look
at them, stepped to the spot where Josefina was lying,
lifted her from the ground, and with her in his arms, he
tried to pass out, but Amalia stood in the way.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>Then she tried to snatch the child from him. But Luis
stretched out his hand, caught the Valencian by the hair,
and after shaking her roughly three or four times, he cast
her away from him, and made for the drawing-room door.
He flew down the staircase and out into the street, where
his carriage was waiting for him, and jumping into it with
his precious burthen, he said to the coachman:</p>

<p>"Quick, to the Grange!"</p>

<p>The heavy vehicle jolted along the badly paved streets,
and he was not long in reaching the high road. The moon
shone high in the firmament. Great thick clouds floated
across its disc, but it reappeared directly. A stormy wind
soughed in the upper atmospheric regions. Silence and
peace reigned below.</p>

<p>Josefina still remained unconscious. The count wiped<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>
the blood away with his handkerchief. Then he tried
to revive her by imprinting long, passionate kisses upon her
alabaster cheek.</p>

<p>At last her eyes opened, she looked at the count with
a strange intensity and then they lighted up with a sweet
smile:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Luis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my life, it is I."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me to?"</p>

<p>"Where you like."</p>

<p>"Take me far away, very far away! Take me to your
house. Take me, even if you can't feed me. Being with
you I shan't mind dying."</p>

<p>The count pressed her to his heart and covered her with
kisses.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you are going to my house," he exclaimed,
whilst tears bathed his cheeks. "You shall never leave
it, because they would have to take my life before they
should take you. Listen, Josefina, I am going to tell you
something. Try and understand. Make an effort and
you will do so. I am your father. The Señores de
Quiñones took you into their house; but I am your father.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Luis, I understand you."</p>

<p>"They took you in because I was wrong enough to give
you up to them instead of keeping you with me."</p>

<p>"Now I understand you, Luis. You were not wrong.
You were good, and I love you."</p>

<p>"Yes, child of my soul, I love you more than my life.
Forgive me."</p>

<p>"I love you too&mdash;but not them. I loved godmother
once, but not now. She has beaten me so much. If
you could but know! She bit me, she scratched me,
she dragged me on the ground, she told Concha to
beat me with a broom, she tied me with a string like a
dog."<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></p>

<p>"Don't, don't, you kill me!" said Luis, sobbing.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Luis, don't cry! See how kind you are; you
are crying for me."</p>

<p>"Should I not cry for you as you are my daughter? I am
your father! Don't you know it, don't you know it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it. You are my father, and I am your
daughter. I am sleepy&mdash;let me sleep upon your breast."</p>

<p>And her little fair head sank in sleep. The count bent
his own to imprint a kiss upon her brow, and his lips
encountered the fire of fever.</p>

<p>The little creature enjoyed a few minutes lethargic sleep.
Occasional cold shivers ran through her delicate little body.
At last she awoke with a cry.</p>

<p>"Luis, they are taking me away! Look at them, look
at them! There they are!" Her eyes were full of wild
terror.</p>

<p>"No, daughter, no, they are trees on the road waving
their branches towards us."</p>

<p>"Don't you see Don Pedro threatening me? Don't you
hear what he is saying?"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my soul, it is the roaring of the wind."</p>

<p>"You are right. They are gone now. Look how the
moon is shining! Look at the beautiful fields and the
quantities of flowers! A palace of crystal! There is a
child playing with a white cat. How lovely! It is prettier
than Rose. Let me play with her, Luis."</p>

<p>"You shall play as much as you like, and I will buy you
a white cat and a white dove that will eat out of your
hand."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want you to spend money; I am contented
if you don't leave me."</p>

<p>"Never, you shall live with me always, because you are
my daughter. Go to sleep, my heart."</p>

<p>"Darkness again! It has come back. Take them
away, Luis, take them! for God's sake! How they are
pulling at me!"<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, you are with me. Look, there is the
moon again. Do you see how it shines? Sleep, my heart."</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;Yes I see the fields full of flowers&mdash;I see the
white cat&mdash;The child is not there&mdash;Where is it, Luis?"</p>

<p>"It is in my house waiting to play with you. We are
very near now. Go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes, Luis, I am going to sleep. You tell me to, don't
you? I ought to obey you because I am your daughter.
I am cold. Hold me tighter."</p>

<p>He pressed her closer and closer to his breast. Josefina
slept at last. The carriage rolled along the deserted road,
past the fields lighted by the light of the moon. The wind
moaned in the distance. The trees began to wave their
branches.</p>

<p>The drive to the Grange was reached.</p>

<p>Luis bent his head to wake the child, but on giving her
a kiss, he felt the coldness of death. He raised her
quickly, he shook her violently several times as he called
her loudly:</p>

<p>"Josefina! Daughter! daughter! daughter! Wake
up!"</p>

<p>The fair head of the child fell from one side to the other
like a lily with a broken stem.</p>
